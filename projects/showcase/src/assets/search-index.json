Vadym's viewer is the tool of choice if you don't need the menu, the sidebar, or anything else beyond displaying the PDF file. ngx-extended-pdf-viewer is the tool of choice if you need the fancy UI, too.\n\nIf you need to display multiple PDF files simultaneously and if you don't mind using iFrames, I recommend <a target=\"#\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdfjs-viewer\">ng2-pdfjs-viewer</a>. The library has less features than ngx-extended-pdf-viewer, but its iFrame approach allows it do some tricks that make it unique. Such as opening a PDF file in a new tab or a new window, or - as I've mentioned before - displaying multiple PDF files side-by-side.\n\nIf you need to modify PDF files, that's the realm of the commercial solutions. I didn't do much market research, so take my hints with a grain of salt. PDFTron looks interesting, as well as the commercial sibling of ej2-angular-pdfviewer.\n\n## Using the native browser support\n\nIn a way, it's crazy to use a library to display PDF files in a browser. Every modern browser can show PDF files natively. Just drag and drop a PDF file into the browser, and you'll see a PDF viewer that's every bit as powerful as Adobe's native PDF viewer.\n\nOnly - well, there are some outdated versions of our good old friend called Internet Explorer out there. Plus, many other browsers don't support PDF files. Sometimes it's not enough to focus on the evergreen browsers. Adding insult to injury, there's no standardized way to embed a PDF file on a web page, and the public API is limited. What you can do is using the `<object>` tag like so:\n\n```html\n<object data=\"https://example.com/test.pdf#page=2\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">\n  <p>Your browser does not support PDFs. <a href=\"https://example.com/test.pdf\">Download the PDF</a>.</p>\n</object>\n```\n\nPhilipp Spiess has an <a target=\"#\" href=\"https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/open-pdf-in-your-web-app/\">exhaustive roundup of this approach</a>. Highly recommended. Be warned: Along the way, he's trying to sell you a professional PDF tool which may or may not be useful. I wouldn't know because both BeyondJava.net and pdfviewer.net are very serious about never doing advertising. So I didn't even evaluate it.\n\n## Enter pdf.js\n\nEvery other solution (well, as far as I know) is based on <a href=\"https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/\">an open-source PDF viewer called pdf.js</a>. It's written in JavaScript, so it's easy to use the library in your own project. It's also the PDF viewer used by Firefox and Google Chrome. In other words: it's battle-proven and rock-solid.\n\nSeveral tutorials are telling you how easy it is to use pdf.js. For example, the author I've already quoted, Philipp Spiess, <a href=\"https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/render-pdfs-in-the-browser-with-pdf-js/\">has written a nice walkthrough</a>.\n\nThe catch is it's easy as long as you're happy with just displaying the PDF file without any bells and whistles. As soon as you want to add more features - such as scaling, searching, rotating, printing - complexity quickly gets through the roof. Most tutorials solve the problem by embedding Mozilla's web viewer in an iFrame. The good news is that this approach works. Nonetheless, in many projects, that's a no-go. iFrames went out of fashion for a reason.\n\nWhat we're looking for is a simple but powerful solution.\n\n## https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdfjs-viewer\n\nDid I say nobody's using iFrames in 2020? A developer nicknamed Code Hippie does. As things go, they implemented their PDF viewer almost at the same time as I did. Their approach is very simple: create an Angular component wrapping the PDF viewer in an iFrame. You can send parameters to the PDF viewer using the URL. That's quite a few parameters, so chances are you're happy with this approach.\n\nThe iFrame approach is simple and robust. If you're not happy with ngx-extended-pdf-viewer, go for the library of Codehippie. You'll lose some options - but most likely you don't need them anyways.\n\nAs of December 2023, the library uses a rather old version of pdf.js (2.2), but that shouldn't be a problem in most applications.\n\n## ng2-pdf-viewer: Displaying PDF files in a no-nonsense way\n\nThis library is the way to go if you just want to render PDF files and nothing else. No toolbar, no thumbnails, just the plain PDF file. <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdf-viewer\">ng2-pdf-viewer</a> gives you a decent API and is popular enough to feel trustworthy. At the time of writing, it saw more than 150.000 downloads a month. Some time ago, I presented the library in this showcase, but I removed it again because of compatibility problem with current Angular versions. As of December 2023, the library uses a rather old version of pdf.js (2.6), but that shouldn't be a problem in most applications.\n\n## ng2-image-viewer\n\n<b>Warning:</b> ng2-image-viewer is no longer maintained. The GitHub project has been archived. Use this library at your own risk. Plus, the README.md file of the repository contains a link to a questionable site. It seems the base library, ImageViewer, has been abandoned, and it's website has been aquired by a betting portal. If you want to use this library, please be very careful. As a measure of caution, I've removed the hyperlinks. Nonetheless, the library still looks promising, so I don't want to remove this section.\n\nThis nice library is an image viewer at it's heart. The author, Breno Prata, took the ImageViewer library, wrapped in a carousel, and added PDF support to it.\n\nAs far as I can see, ng2-image-viewer relies on the browser to render the PDF file natively. Don't hope for Internet Explorer support. Plus, the PDF viewer is always shown completely, without options to customize it. Other than that, it's a nice little library if you need to display the PDF file in a carousel.\n\n## Angular.js 1.x\n\nAre you still using AngularJS 1.x? Then you should check out <a href=\"https://github.com/legalthings/angular-pdfjs-viewer\">angular-pdfjs-viewer</a> is a fine library. Unfortunately, the authors ceased to maintain it, so use it at your own risk.\n\n## ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n\nHow does ngx-extended-pdf-viewer compare to the other options? Basically, it offers Internet Explorer 11 support, offers a wide range of attributes and even events. You can call a method when a document has been loaded or a page has been rendered. Plus, it offers two-way binding for many attributes, such as the page number and the zoom factor. You can store the user's zoom preference in the database and fetch it again the next morning, when the user starts working with a fresh browser."

That's necessary because other auth servers don't require the prefix.\n\n## Example project\n\n[Marcel Karras](https://github.com/MKITConsulting) kindly provided a demo project: [Link to demo project](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer-issues/tree/main/oauth2-ngx-extended-pdf-viewer-test).\n\nTo run it, just follow the instructions of the readme file.\n\n## Other auth providers\n\nHMAC *should* work similarly, but it doesn't require the prefix `\"Bearer \"`. Just pass the access token to `authorization`.\n\nIf you need more flexibility, you can\n\n- use the attribute `httpHeaders` to pass an arbitrary array of http headers\n- set `[authorization]=\"true\"`. In this case, the authorization header is not set. However, the flag `withCredentials` of the XMLHttpRequest is set to true. If pdf.js uses the modern fetch API instead, `withCredentials` activates the option `credentials: 'include'`\n\n### Links for more details\n\n- [Documentation on XMLHttpRequests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials)\n- [Documentation on Fetch API - sending a request with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#sending_a_request_with_credentials_included)"

That's because the PDF form has its own default value.\n\nThe Angular application passes a different default value using `[formData]`. But because the value gets passed _before_ the page has loaded, the default value of the PDF form takes precedence.\n\nTo ensure that the value coming from your code is used instead, you have to delay populating `[formData]` until the page has been rendered. Which approach you should use highly depends on what you do with the viewer and the form data.\n\nHere are some ideas:\n- Use `ngAfterViewInit`\n- Use `pageRendered` event of the `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer`"

While this is not possible with this library - it is a viewer, not an editor - you can do something similar. You add an an image to the annotation layer. In most cases, you won't see the difference.\n\n#### TypeScript\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\nstandalone: false,  ... })\nexport class EditorApiComponent {\n\n  constructor(private pdfService: NgxExtendedPdfViewerService) {}\n\n  public async addImage(): Promise<void> {\n    const { left, bottom, right, top, rotation } = parameters;\n    await this.pdfService.addImageToAnnotationLayer({\n      urlOrDataUrl: 'assets/images/ChatGPT-PDF-Viewer-Logo.jpg',\n      page: 11,       // optional parameter\n      left: 0,        // default value: 0\n      bottom: '0%',   // default value: 0\n      right: '100%',  // default value: 100%\n      top: '100%',    // default value: 100%\n      rotation: 270   // default value: 0\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Coordinates\n\nThe parameters `left`, `bottom`, `right`, and `top` can be:\n\n- percentages (e.g. `left: '50%'`)\n- pixels (e.g. `left: '100px'`)\n- PDF coordinates (e.g. `left: 100`)\n\nIf you omit a coordinate, it's put at the logical origin:\n\n- omitting left amounts to left: 0\n- omitting bottom amounts to bottom: 0\n- omitting right amounts to right: \"100%\"\n- omitting top amounts to top: \"100%\"\n\n**Caveat**: In Chrome, the calculation of the bottom coordinate appears to be off by a few pixels. This discrepancy seems to stem from a bug in the PDF rendering engine, resulting in a canvas that is larger than expected (at least in my demo documents). This issue does not occur in Firefox.\n\n### Large Files\n\nThe PDF viewer renders pages lazily. If they aren't going to be used soon, the page is not rendered. If you've got a large file, a major part of the pages are just placeholders.\n\nThis, in turn, means you can't add an annotation. If you want to add annotations to large files reliably, catch the event `(annotationLayerRendered)` and add the annotations in the event handler. Note that this event is triggered for every page individually. The event handler should add the annotations that belong to this particular page, but not to other pages.\n\n## Low Level\n\n### Adding and exporting text, drawing, images and highlights\n\nYou can add texts and drawings programmatically. However, the PDF viewer doesn't support adding highlights programmatically. As for images, that's supported, but using the high-level API (see [Adding Images](#adding-images)).\n\n**Breaking change between pdf.js 3.5 and 3.9**: The coordinates of the serialized drawings have changed. Please keep in mind that this is an internal API of pdf.js, so it's subject to change without notice.\n\nYou can export text, drawings, images, and highlight you've added to a PDF file. For more details on exporting text and images refer to the Exporting Section.\n\n- [Export Text](./exporting/text)\n- [Export Image](./exporting/image)\n\n#### TypeScript\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\nstandalone: false,  ... })\nexport class EditorApiComponent {\n\n  constructor(private pdfService: NgxExtendedPdfViewerService) {}\n\n  public addTextEditor(): void {\n    const textEditorAnnotation: FreeTextEditorAnnotation = {\n      annotationType: 3,\n      color: [Math.floor(Math.random() * 255), Math.floor(Math.random() * 255), Math.floor(Math.random() * 255)],\n      fontSize: Math.random() * 10 + 20,\n      value: 'Hello world!',\n      pageIndex: 0,\n      rect: [\n        50, // height?\n        Math.random() * 500 + 350, // y\n        Math.random() * 400, // x\n        100, // width?\n      ],\n      rotation: 0,\n    };\n    this.pdfService.addEditorAnnotation(textEditorAnnotation);\n  }\n\n  public async addDrawing(): Promise<void> {\n    const x = 400*Math.random();\n    const y = 350+500*Math.random();\n    const drawing: InkEditorAnnotation = {\n      annotationType: 15,\n      color: [Math.floor(Math.random() * 255), Math.floor(Math.random() * 255), Math.floor(Math.random() * 255)],\n      thickness: Math.random()*10,\n      opacity: 1,\n      paths: {\n          bezier: [x+0.5, y, x+0.5, y+44, x+44, y+66, x+88, y+44],\n          points: [x+0.5, y, x+0.5, y+44],\n        },\n      pageIndex: 0,\n      rect: [x, y, x+100, y+66],\n      rotation: 0,\n    };\n    await this.pdfService.addEditorAnnotation(drawing);\n  }\n\n  public exportAnnotations(): void {\n    this.selectedTabIndex = 4;\n    this.rawAnnotations = this.pdfService.getSerializedAnnotations();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Removing Editor\n\nBoth forms and editor annotations are PDF annotation, so it might happen the APIs get in the way of each other. Until version 19.6.6, removing an editor would also remove the form fields. This has been fixed in version 19.6.7.\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\nstandalone: false,  ... })\nexport class EditorApiComponent {\n\n  constructor(private pdfService: NgxExtendedPdfViewerService) {}\n\n  public removeEditors(): void {\n    this.pdfService.removeEditorAnnotations();\n  }\n\n  public removeTextEditors(): void {\n    const filter = (serial: any) =>\n      serial?.annotationType === 3 &&\n      serial?.pageIndex === 0;\n    this.pdfService.removeEditorAnnotations(filter);\n  }\n\n  public removeDrawingEditors(): void {\n    const filter = (serial: any) => serial.annotationType === 15;\n    this.pdfService.removeEditorAnnotations(filter);\n  }\n}\n```"

That's one of the messages you can almost always safely ignore, so it doesn't make sense to pump it into, say, an ELK stack or Splunk.

The API find controller can be used by programmers, and it has the advantage that the user still can use the find functionality without interfering with the API find controller.\n\nBoth controllers are used via the `NgxExtendedPdfViewerService`. You can inject this service normally.\n\n## Basic usage\n\nThe difference in code is very minimal. Besides setting a parameter there isn't any difference.\n\n### TS \n\n#### Find via User Find Controller\n\n```typescript\nconst searchText = 'some search text';\nthis.ngxExtendedPdfViewerService.find(searchtext, {\n  useSecondaryFindcontroller: false\n});\n```\n\n#### Find via API Find Controller\n\n```typescript\nconst searchText = 'some search text';\nthis.ngxExtendedPdfViewerService.find(searchtext, {\n  useSecondaryFindcontroller: true // <- Set this to true\n});\n```\n\n### With all find options\n\n```typescript\ninterface FindOptions {\n  highlightAll?: boolean;\n  matchCase?: boolean;\n  wholeWords?: boolean;\n  matchDiacritics?: boolean;\n  dontScrollIntoView?: boolean;\n  findMultiple?: boolean;\n  regexp?: boolean;\n  useSecondaryFindcontroller?: boolean;\n}\n\n\nconst searchText = 'some search text';\nthis.ngxExtendedPdfViewerService.find(searchtext, {\n  highlightAll: this.highlightAll,\n  matchCase: this.matchCase,\n  wholeWords: this.wholeWord,\n  matchDiacritics: this.matchDiacritics,\n  findMultiple: this.multiple,\n  regexp: this.matchRegExp,\n  dontScrollIntoView: this.dontScrollIntoView,\n  useSecondaryFindcontroller: false\n});\n```\n\n## Find Results\n\nThe event `(updateFindMatchesCount)` contains three attributes telling you about the search result:\n\n- `matches` is an array of arrays of numbers. The first dimension is the page index. If there's a find result on a page, the inner array is a list of find positions. Basically, such a position the number of characters before the hit.\n- `matchesLength` is a similar array of arrays of numbers. In a nutshell, it tells you how long your search term is.\n\nYou can get the text of each page by calling `ngxPdfViewerService.getPageAsText()`. If you want to find out which part of the DOM shows the find result, you need to catch the event `renderedtextlayerhighlights`.\n\n### HTML\n\n```html\n<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n  src=\"/assets/pdfs/Portugues-para-principiantes.pdf\"\n  (updateFindMatchesCount)=\"updateFindMatchesCount($event)\"\n  (updateFindState)=\"updateFindState($event)\">\n</ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```\n\n### TypeScript\n\n```typescript\nupdateFindMatchesCount(result: FindResultMatchesCount) {\n  // ... your logic\n}\n\nupdateFindState(result: FindState) {\n  // ... your logic\n}\n```\n\nThis example shows how to access the `renderedtextlayerhighlights` event.\n\n```typescript\nthis.PDFViewerApplication?.eventBus?.on('renderedtextlayerhighlights', (event: RenderedTextLayerHighlights) => {\n  event.highlights.forEach((highlight) => {\n    highlight.style.border = '2px solid black';\n  });\n});\n```"

    "title": "Getting Started",
    "route": "/basics/getting-started/",
    "content": "## Prequisites and announcement\n\nYou can get the PDF viewer up and running in roughly two minutes. You need node.js, npm and a current version of Angular. This library aims to be compatible to the last four versions of Angular, which gives you two years time to update.\n\nWith very few exceptions, I only maintain the most current version of the viewer. As much as I'd like to provide bug fixes to older versions, I don't have enough time to spare.\n\n## Just in case you haven't got an Angular project yet\n\nThe instructions below assume you've already got an Angular project. If you haven't, here's what to do:\n\n- Install node.js. Make sure it's a current version with an even version number.\n- Install the Angular CLI by running the command `npm i -g @angular/cli`.\n- Create a new Angular app by running the command `ng new my-favorite-project`.\n\nI've described these steps in more detail <a href=\"https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/2010#issuecomment-1850778118\">here</a>.\n\n## Setting up the PDF viewer\n\n### Schematics (recommended)\n\n1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root folder of your project.\n2. Run this command and accept the defaults:\n```batch\nng add ngx-extended-pdf-viewer@latest\n``` \n3. If you need a specific version of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer, replace `@latest` by the version number you need. `@latest` gets you the newest stable version. If you omit `@latest`, Angular tries to detect the latest compatible version. Note that this may be an alpha version. Usually these alpha version are useful, too, but they ship without promises. By definition, an alpha version is a version that might be broken.\n4. Add the new component `<app-example-pdf-viewer>` to your `<app-component>` to display the PDF file.\n\nAfter that, you'll probably want to delete the example PDF file and move the code out of the example component.\n\n### Angular CLI\n\nInstall the library with `npm install`:\n\n```batch\nnpm i ngx-extended-pdf-viewer --save\n```\n\nNext, open the file `angular.json` (or `.angular-cli.json` if you're using an older version of Angular) and configure Angular to copy the `assets` folder of the library into the `assets` folder of your application:\n\n```json\n  \"assets\": [\n    \"src/favicon.ico\",\n    \"src/assets\",\n    {\n      \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n      \"input\": \"node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/\",\n      \"output\": \"/assets/\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"scripts\": []\n```\n\nThis simply copies the entire assets folder. If you're concerned about disk memory, you can omit the subfolder `additional-locale`. If you need only one language, you can reduce the list to `locale.json` and your language folder.\n\n_Hint:_ There are two ways to define the language files needed for the labels of the buttons and screen elements of the PDF viewer. The second method is described below in the \"internationalization\" section.\n\nYou can choose between the stable release of pdf.js or the \"bleeding edge\" version. That latter is a version I regularly update with the newest changes from the Mozilla team. But be warned, the developer version is bleeding edge. It's a far cry from being a thoroughly tested release. The automated tests at Mozilla are fairly good, but it's always possible I do a mistake when merging the changes.\n\nIf you want to use the \"bleeding edge\" version of pdf.js, add these lines:\n\n```json\n  \"assets\": [\n    \"src/favicon.ico\",\n    \"src/assets\",\n    {\n      \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n      \"input\": \"node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/bleeding-edge/\",\n      \"output\": \"/bleeding-edge/\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"scripts\": []\n```\n\n\nYou will also need to add those lines to your component :\n1. An import statement\n```ts\nimport { pdfDefaultOptions } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';\n```\n2. A line in your constructor\n```ts \npdfDefaultOptions.assetsFolder = 'bleeding-edge';\n```\n\n#### Almost there!\n\nAdd `NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule` to the import section of your module file. If your IDE doesn't find\nthe import automatically, here it is:\n\n```typescript\nimport { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';\n```\n\nNow you can display the PDF file like so:\n\n```html\n<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]=\"'assets/example.pdf'\"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```\n\n### JHipster 6.6 + ngx-extended-pdf-viewer 2.0.0+\n\n**Caveat**: I don't support non-standard installations.

Every modern browser supports PDF files natively.\n\n`<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>` brings precisely this browser to the Angular world. When I started to investigate the topic, I quickly learned that it's not easy to display a PDF file natively. There are ways to do it - but if you want to implement an application running on all platforms, things get difficult in virtually no time. Especially if you need to support Internet Explorer 11.\n\nThis project simply wraps Mozilla's PDF viewer as an Angular component. It's the same PDF viewer both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox use. In other words: it uses a battle-proven, rock-solid technology.\n\n## Talking about the memory footprint: how bad is it?\n\nThere's no point denying it: viewing PDF files comes with a huge memory penalty. Mozilla's PDF viewer consists of four files, weighing in at roughly two megabytes. Minification and Gzip reduce this to roughly half a megabyte.\n\nHowever, almost every alternative I know also relies on Mozilla's PDF viewer, so you get a similar memory and bandwidth penalty.\n\n## Is pdfviewer.net open to document other PDF viewers?\n\nYes, of course. At the moment I focus on my own project. In the long run, I intend to include other PDF viewer as well as approaches to view PDF natively in the browser."

Below, you'll find a high-level abstraction of this tree. Your customization doesn't have to follow this structure. It's just the default.\n- The customization hooks defined by <ngx-extended-pdf-viewer> allow you to modify certain subtrees. Currently there are nine hooks:\n  - `[customToolbar]` allows you to modify the entire black bar above the PDF document.\n  - `[customFreeFloatingBar]` allows you to add your own toolbar. The original use-case is a toolbar floating above the PDF file. But if you're familiar with CSS magic, you're probably not limited to that.\n  - `[customSecondaryToolbar]` represents the menu at the right-hand side of the PDF viewer.\n  - `[customFindbar]` allows you to define your own findbar.\n  - `[customFindbarButtons]` allows you to modify the entire find bar (the black bar that's shown after typing CTRL+F).\n  - `[customFindbarInputArea]` is responsible for a small part of the find bar: the input field and the previous/next buttons.\n  - `[customSidebar]` defines your own sidebar. See the [custom sidebar demo](./customization/sidebar).\n  - `[customThumbnail]` See the [custom thumbnails demo](./customization/thumbnails).\n  - `[customPdfViewer]` is your door to modify everything except the CSS imports.\n- The underlying PDF framework, pdf.js, recognizes the buttons and menu items by their id. If you want to modify an existing functionality, keep in mind you have to provide the id. Otherwise, pdf.js might raise an exception, and your custom button won't work.\n- However, most buttons are component you can either use or copy. You can see the full list of toolbar buttons in the [GitHub repository of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/blob/main/projects/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/src/lib/toolbar/pdf-toolbar/pdf-toolbar.component.html).\n- I'm sure there's a lot of headroom for improvements.

    "route": "/customization/menus/",
    "content": "## Secondary menu (since version 18)\n\nSince version 18, almost every button is able to move dynamically from the toolbar to the secondary menu. The idea is to move buttons from the toolbar to the secondary menu until the toolbar fits on the screen, so small displays can still show all buttons.\n\nEvery toolbar button has a `show<ButtonName>` attribute which defines the breakpoint of the button. If the screen is wider than the breakpoint, the button is displayed in the toolbar. Otherwise it's displayed in the secondary menu. There are also two special values: `always-visible` means the button is never moved to the secondary menu. Conversely, `always-in-secondary-menu` means the button always hides in the secondary menu.\n\nThere's an interactive live-demo at the [responsive design page](./customization/responsive-design) of this showcase.\n\nIf you use the `<pdf-shy-button>` component to define your custom buttons they also benefit from responsive design. However, there's a catch: if you're using the `<pdf-shy-button>`, you can use the `action` attribute to define custom logic. Basically, the `action` attribute is treated like a fat arrow function - and that means it's inheriting the `this` reference from the `PdfShyButton` class. The constructor of your button component is never called, and neither is `ngOnInit`. Probably that sounds more confusing than it is, so don't worry - it's easy to implement custom \"shy\" buttons. Just keep in mind that this is not what you might expect.\n\n\n### Adding custom buttons to the toolbar and/or the secondary menu\n\nThe `<pdf-shy-button>` allows you to benefit from seamless integration into the toolbar and the secondary menu. A typical shy button looks like so:\n\n```html\n<pdf-shy-button\n  [cssClass]=\"'always-in-secondary-menu' | responsiveCSSClass\"\n  title=\"Infinite scroll\"\n  primaryToolbarId=\"infiniteScroll\"\n  l10nId=\"infinite_scroll\"\n  [toggled]=\"pageViewMode == 'infinite-scroll'\"\n  [action]=\"onClick\"\n  l10nLabel=\"pdfjs-infinite-scroll-button-label\"\n  [order]=\"3400\"\n  [closeOnClick]=\"false\"\n  image=\"<svg aria-hidden='true' \n          focusable='false' \n          xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' \n          height= '24' viewBox= '0 -960 960 960' \n          width='24'>\n           <path d= '...'/>\n         </svg>\"\n>\n</pdf-shy-button>\n```\n\nThe clumsy `[cssClass]` definition allows you to define the breakpoint using a shortcut. Legal values are `always-visible` , `always-in-secondary-menu` , `xxs` , `xs` , `sm` , `md` , `lg` , `xl` , and `xxl`. `xxl` means the button is only visible in the toolbar on very large screens, while `xxs` means it's visible on fairly small screens.\n\nThe two `l10n` attributes use the translation tables of pdf.js. They're useless for you unless you can use one of the pre-defined texts of the viewer.properties file. In most cases, `[title]` should to the trick just as well.\n\n`[order]` determines where the button appears in the secondary menu. The default buttons use increments of 100, so you can insert 99 custom menu items between two default menu items. If the button shows in the toolbar, its position is determined by the position in the source code (plus CSS - in other words, it's exactly the behavior you'd expect).\n\nThe `[action]` attribute is a bit tricky. You can't use this in the event listener method because the event listener is used both for the toolbar (`this` is available here) and the secondary menu (`this` is undefined here). I'm sure I've selected a clumsy solution, but here's my current approach:\n\n```typescript\nexport class PdfInfiniteScrollComponent implements OnDestroy {\n  @Input() \n  public pageViewMode: PageViewModeType;\n\n  @Output()\n  public pageViewModeChange = new EventEmitter<PageViewModeType>();\n\n  public onClick?: () => void;\n\n  constructor() {\n    const emitter = this.pageViewModeChange;\n    this.onClick = () => {\n      setTimeout(() => {\n           emitter.emit('infinite-scroll');\n      });\n    };\n  }\n\n  public ngOnDestroy(): void {\n    this.onClick = undefined;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe key idea is to define the event listener in the constructor, where you can capture this in a constant."

That's an unpleasant experience, so the PDF viewer renders one or two pages in advance.\n\nWhile that's a good compromise between energy consumption and user experience in most cases, some users reported they need more flexibility. ngx-extended-pdf-viewer allows you to define a custom pre-rendering strategy. You can use it to render more pages below the current page in advance, but you can also use it to render pages above the currently visible page. The latter is useful to allow quick backward scrolling after jumping to a new chapter or jumping to a new page by entering the page number.\n\nNote that rendering too many pages in advance may have the opposite effect. Keeping your CPU busy results in a slow UI and a bad user experience.\n\n### Example Algorithm\n\nThe algorithm below increases the number of pre-rendered pages to two pages backward and up to five pages in advance.\n\n#### HTML\n\n```html\n <ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n    [src]=\"'./assets/pdfs/The Public Domain - Enclosing the Commons of the Mind.pdf'\"\n    [zoom]=\"'page-width'\"\n    [height]=\"'auto'\"\n    [(page)]=\"page\"\n    [(pageLabel)]=\"pageLabel\"\n    [textLayer]=\"true\"\n    (pageRendered)=\"onPageRendered()\">\n</ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```\n\n#### TypeScript\n\n```typescript\n @Component({ ... })\nexport class PrerenderingComponent {\n  public spreadMode: 'off' | 'even' | 'odd' = 'off';\n\n  constructor(private pdfViewerService: NgxExtendedPdfViewerService) {\n    pdfDefaultOptions.ignoreDestinationZoom = true;\n  }\n\n  public onPageRendered(): void {\n    if (!this.pdfViewerService.isRenderQueueEmpty()) {\n      // try again later when the pages requested by the pdf.js core or the user have been rendered\n      setTimeout(() => this.onPageRendered(), 100);\n    }\n\n    const pagesBefore = this.spreadMode === 'off' ? 2 : 2;\n    const pagesAfter = this.spreadMode === 'off' ? 2 : 5;\n    let startPage = Math.max(this.page - pagesBefore, 1);\n    let endPage = Math.min(this.page  + pagesAfter, this.pdfViewerService.numberOfPages());\n\n    const renderedPages = this.pdfViewerService.currentlyRenderedPages();\n\n    for (let page = startPage; page <= endPage; page++) {\n      const pageIndex = page - 1;\n      if (!this.pdfViewerService.hasPageBeenRendered(pageIndex)) {\n          this.pdfViewerService.addPageToRenderQueue(pageIndex);\n          break; // break because you can request only one page at a time\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Buffer for rendered pages\n\nIf you're running on tight memory constraints, you can reduce the size of the number of pre-rendered pages. By default, `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` keeps up to 50 pages in memory. To reduce or increase this setting, set `pdfDefaultOptions.defaultCacheSize` to a different number."

Limiting the print range is useful for very large documents that'd crash your browser - such as trying to print documents containing several hundred pages with Internet Explorer 11.\n\n## TypeScript\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\nstandalone: false,  ... })\nexport class PrintRangeComponent {\n  constructor(private printService: NgxExtendedPdfViewerService) {}\n\n  public print(): void {\n    const range: PDFPrintRange = {\n      from: 1,\n      to: 10,\n      excluded: [2, 4, 6, 8],\n    };\n    this.printService.print(range);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Setting Print Range\n\nCalling `NgxExtendedPdfViewerService.setPrintRange()` limits the print range of the print button and `CTRL+P`. This also includes the programmatic API `print()` if the parameter is omitted.\n\nTo prevent nasty surprises, implement an `ngDestroy()` callback and use it to call `NgxExtendedPdfViewerService.removePrintRange()`.\n\n### TypeScript\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\nstandalone: false,  ... })\nexport class PrintRangeComponent {\n  constructor(private printService: NgxExtendedPdfViewerService) {}\n\n  public setPrintRange(): void {\n    const range: PDFPrintRange = {\n      from: 1,\n      to: 10,\n      excluded: [2, 4, 6, 8],\n    };\n    this.printService.setPrintRange(range);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Override Browser Print\n\nSetting the attribute `replaceBrowserPrint` allows you to replace the browser default print functionality by printing the PDF file. No matter what your web page looks like, if `replaceBrowserPrint` is true, both the keys `CTRL+P` and the print menu of the browser print the PDF file. If you set `replaceBrowserPrint=\"false\"`, both `CTRL+P` and the print menu print the web page.\n\n**Note**: Starting with version 16.0.0, the `replaceBrowserPrint` is active by default.\n\n### HTML\n```html\n<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n  [src]=\"'/assets/pdfs/BootsFaces_Deep_Dive_1.0.pdf'\"\n  zoom=\"50%\"\n  [replaceBrowserPrint]=\"true\">\n</ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```\n\n## Auto Rotation\n\nBy default, the PDF viewer rotates landscape pages when printing. You can switch this off by setting `enablePrintAutoRotate` to `false`. This is useful if you want to print a PDF file with a mix of portrait and landscape pages, and you want to keep the orientation of the pages as they are in the PDF file.\n\n### HTML\n\n```html\n<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n  [src]=\"src\"\n  [enablePrintAutoRotate]=\"false\">\n</ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```\n\n## Print Resolution\n\nThe attribute `printResolution` specifies the print resolution, with a default value of 150 dpi. If the specified resolution exceeds the browser's capabilities, it is adjusted downward, including a 5% margin for safety.\n\n### HTML\n\n```html\n<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n  [src]=\"'/assets/pdfs/BootsFaces_Deep_Dive_1.0.pdf'\"\n  [printResolution]=\"300\">\n</ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```"

If it does, the response headers have the attributes\n\n- \"Content-Length\"\n- \"Accept-Ranges\": \"bytes\",\n- \"Content-Encoding\"\n\n## CORS\n\nIf your PDF file is served by a different server than the Angular application, you must add the CORS headers to the response.

In most cases, this means it takes longer until the PDF file is shown, so use this option only as a last resort.\n\n**Caveat**: When I tried this, I didn't manage to disable range request.

On smaller screens, some of these buttons are shifted to the secondary menu. A few actions are only available in the secondary menu: the scroll mode, the spread modes, and the document properties. In a future version, I might add toolbar icons for these icons, so the corresponding attributes are also called `showXXXButton`, ignoring the fact that currently, these actions are currently only available in the secondary menu.\n\nI've breakpoints to the buttons to show as many buttons as possible on any screen. However, if you don't need every button, you've got more available screen estate. So you can override my choice of breakpoint by setting, for example, `showXXXButton=\"xs\"`. `xs` means the button shows if the PDF viewer is at least 490 pixel wide. `sm` means the button is visible if the PDF viewer is at least 560 pixels wide, and so on until `xxl`, which hides buttons if the PDF viewer is less than 830 pixels wide.\n\nNote that these width don't refer to the width of the screen. That's a difference to the definition of reponsive breakpoints in Tailwind, Bootstrap or Material Design. The PDF viewer frequently is smaller than the screen, so I went the extra mile to define breakpoints relative to the component width.\n\nYou can modify the breakpoints themselves if my default selection of 490, 560, 610, 660, 740, and 830 doesn't match your requirements. To do so, set the static attributes of the class `PdfBreakpoints`. You can experiment with these settings on the third tab of this demo.\n\nThe PDF viewer hides rarely used buttons on small screens, pushing them to the secondary menu. However, if you're showing only a subset of the buttons, the default are an ill match. So you can tweak this to fit your needs.\nSetting `showXXXButton=\"xs\"` means it's visible on very small screens, `showXXXButton=\"sm\"` means it's shown on small but hidden on tiny screens, and so on.\n\n## Custom Breakpoints \n\nYou can fine-tune when a breakpoint triggers. You have to resize the window after modifying the numbers to see the effect.

In theory, the `left` parameter causes the page to scroll to the left by a given percentage. However, that's not always possible, because the horizontal scrollbar doesn't allow for arbitrary scrolling. In particular, 100% would indicate the page scrolls out of the visible area, but the scrollbar doesn't allow that."

Build the ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n   1. `npm run build:lib`\n   2. This is necessary as the showcase depends on it\n2. Build the schematics\n   1. `npm run build-schematics`\n3. Done.\n\nNow you can serve the showcase by running `npm run run:showcase`.\n\n## File Structure\n\nWithin _showcase/src/app_ you find multiple subfolders. Here is what they are meant for.\n\n- _core_: Contains components, directives, service, etc. that are either only used once in the entire app (e.g.: `layout.component.ts`) or that are used by such (e.g.: `block-on-open-sidebar.directive.ts`)\n- _pages_: Contains all the documentation pages. The structure is representative of the menu structure. See also [Building the menu](#Building the menu). The pages are organized by topics.\n- _shared_: Contains components, directives, service, etc. that are shared between multiple places (e.g.: `markdown-content.component.ts`)\n\n\n## Building the menu\n\nTo avoid manually managing all aspects of the menu, it is build automatically based on the `*.routes.ts` files.\n\n`app.routes.ts` is the entry point for the routes and essentially defines the order in which the page topics (About,Basics, etc.) are appearing. What matters is the order in which they get spread into the app routes.\n\n**Example**\n\n```ts\nexport const routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: '',\n    pathMatch: 'full',\n    redirectTo: 'about/introduction',\n  },\n  ...aboutRoutes,\n  ...basicsRoutes,\n  ...contributingRoutes,\n  ...configurationRoutes,\n  ...viewingRoutes,\n  ...findingRoutes,\n  ...customizationRoutes,\n  ...formsRoutes,\n  ...printingRoutes,\n  ...securityRoutes,\n  ...exportingRoutes,\n  ...developerExperienceRoutes,\n];\n\n```\n### Topic Route Files\n\nEach of the route files follow the same structure. They are placed in the top level of their topic folders. That means the `basics.routes.ts` is located under `showcase/src/app/basics` and the one for printing under `showcase/src/app/printing`.\n\nAll route files only define one routes array with one top-level route. The path of this route must be the same as the topic. For example the `basics.routes.ts` has the path 'basics'. This route also always is a route group, which means it does not load any components and adds `RouteGroupData`.\n\n#### Route Groups\n\nA route group does not load any component and only has children. For its data property it adds an object with a `key` (lowercase) and a `name` property (readable string). For type safety we add `<RouteGroupData>` in front of the object.\n\n**Example**\n```ts\n{\n  path: 'basics',\n    data: <RouteGroupData>{\n    key: 'basics', // defines key for tracking\n    name: 'Basics', // appears in the menu \n  },\n    children: [\n      //...\n  ],\n},\n```\n\n#### Route Targets\n\nA route target loads a component and cannot have children. For its data property it adds an object with a `pageTitle` property. This property is only used as the main title (`<h1>`) for pages that use the `content-page.component`. All other pages must define their own main title. For type safety we add `<RouteData>` in front of the data object.\n\n**Example**\n```ts\n{\n  path: 'getting-started',\n    component: GettingStartedPageComponent,\n    data: <RouteData>{\n    pageTitle: 'Getting Started', // main title of the page\n  },\n},\n```\n#### Putting it all together\n\nThe `navigation-config.ts` under _showcase/src/app/core/layout/sidenav_ puts everything together. If you are interested in how that works, this is the place to go. The resulting navigation config then gets used normally in the sidenav component.\n\n## Displaying a documentation page\n\nBesides a few special pages (like this one), all pages use the same layout. This is defined in the `content-page.component` under _showcase/src/app/shared/content-page_. By doing so we can ensure that changes are reflected on all pages equally.\n\nAll documentation pages use a tabbed layout. Some may only have one tab, while some have more. That depends on the content. All pages (except the special ones) have at least a \"Documentation\" tab. Some have a \"Demo\" tab in addition.\n\n### Documentation Tab\n\nThe content of the documentation page is coming from its `text.md` file. This file contains the actual documentation and, if applicable, code examples. It should not contain anything else (no controls, demos, etc.). However, it is allowed to use multiple markdown files if necessary. This could be done, if you need to share the same text on multiple pages. Generally we aim to keep the amount of files to manage low.\n\nThe big advantage of having the documentation in markdown is, that we can make changes easily without worrying about any HTML.\n\n**Example of minimal documentation page**\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'pvs-getting-started-page',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [ContentPageComponent, MarkdownContentComponent],\n  template: `<pvs-content-page>\n    <pvs-markdown src=\"/assets/pages/basics/getting-started/text.md\" />\n  </pvs-content-page>`,\n})\nexport class GettingStartedPageComponent {}\n```\n\n**Note**: All other layouting task are handled by the content page component.\n\n### Demo Tab\n\nA lot of documentation comes with an interactive demo. This demo is always placed in a separate tab, to keep everything organized and consistent.\n\nThe demo is always placed in an `ng-template` and in a `split-view.component`. The controls for the demo are on the left, the PDF Viewer on the right.\n\nThe PDF Viewer always need the following three directives applied (SHOWCASE ONLY):\n- `pvsSetMinifiedLibraryUsage`\n- `pvsSetDefaultViewerHeight`\n- `pvsSetDefaultZoomLevel`\n\nthose directives ensure that we can set default values across the page, without needing to update every single page.\n\nThere is one exception though: If your demo requires a specific height or zoom level, you can skip those directives. The `pvsSetMinifiedLibraryUsage` must never be skipped.\n\n**Example of documentation page with a demo**\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'pvs-blobs-page',\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [\n    ContentPageComponent,\n    MarkdownContentComponent,\n    NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule,\n    SplitViewComponent,\n    SetMinifiedLibraryUsageDirective,\n    ReactiveFormsModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    ButtonDirective,\n    SetDefaultViewerHeightDirective,\n    SetDefaultZoomLevelDirective,\n  ],\n  template: `<pvs-content-page [demoTemplate]=\"demo\">\n    <pvs-markdown src=\"/assets/pages/basics/file-sources/blobs/text.md\" />\n    <pvs-markdown src=\"/assets/pages/basics/file-sources/shared.md\" />\n    <ng-template #demo>\n      <pvs-split-view>\n        \n        // Demo Controls go here\n        \n        <ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n          slot=\"end\"\n          [src]=\"src\"\n          [textLayer]=\"true\"\n          [showPresentationModeButton]=\"true\"\n          pvsSetMinifiedLibraryUsage\n          pvsSetDefaultViewerHeight\n          pvsSetDefaultZoomLevel\n        />\n      </pvs-split-view>\n    </ng-template>\n  </pvs-content-page>`,\n})\nexport class BLOBsPageComponent {\n  // Demo code goes here\n}\n\n```\n\n**Note**: When adding inputs, radio buttons, etc. please use the same structure and CSS classes as the other pages. This ensures a consistent look.\n\n\n## Adding a new page\n\nNow that you know the anatomy of a documentation page, let's talk about how to actually add a new page.\n\nTo make this easier we added a schematic to handle pretty much everything for you. So you do not need to remember how to set everything up. \n\nTo run this schematic, first ensure you have built them. If you followed the setup guide above, you should be good to go. Otherwise, run `npm run build-schematics`.\n\nWhen the schematics are build, you can run `npm run add-documentation-page`. This schematic will prompt you for some information. All prompts have descriptions.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis schematic is not able to create a nested documentation page, like the file source pages. If you need to that, first create the sub-menu group, if it doesn't already exist. Then run the schematic with the actual target path. Once the schematic is done, manually move the newly created route to its actual parent. Be sure to update the path to the `text.md` file, in the new component, too.\n\n## Adding a new top level menu group\n\nSince this should not be a common use case, there is no schematic for this. Here are the steps to manually create a new group.\n\n1. Under `showcase/src/app/pages` create a new folder with the name of the menu group (e.g.: new-stuff)\n2. Create a new routes file in your new folder (e.g.: `new-stuff.routes.ts`) and paste the template from below. Fill in the missing info and ensure it follows the convention mentioned above.\n3. Add the new routes array to `app.routes.ts` with the spread operator. Place it where it makes most sense. (e.g.: `...newStuffRoutes`)\n\nBe aware that the new group will only show once it actually has children.\n\n**Template**\nReplace \"new-stuff\" with the name of the new menu group\n```ts\nimport { Route } from '@angular/router';\nimport { RouteGroupData } from '../../shared/types/route-data.types';\n\nexport const newStuffRoutes: Route[] = [\n  {\n    path: 'new-stuff',\n    data: <RouteGroupData>{\n      name: 'New Stuff',\n      key: 'new-stuff',\n    },\n    children: [\n    ],\n  },\n];\n\n```\n\n## Styling\n\nFor styling we are using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). Some extensions and configurations were made for this showcase, so be sure to familiarize yourself with those.\n\nYou can find the _styles.css_ under _showcase/src_ and the _tailwind.config.js_ in the repository root.\n\n## UI Libraries\n\nWe are not using any UI Library for this showcase.\n\n## General Tips\n\nIf you are unsure on how to approach something, look at the already existing code. If nothing covers your use case, either ask in advance or make reasonable assumptions."

The default configuration is pretty straightforward, as you can see on the right-hand side.\n\nIf you've set up the PDF viewer, but are missing the find dialog and the text selection: that's a performance optimization. Activate the `[textLayer]` to enable these two features.\n\nThe height attribute can often be omitted, too. The showcase only needs it because its layout framework, Angular Material, sets the height of the PDF viewer to zero pixels by default.\n\n### HTML\n\n```html\n<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n   [src]=\"'/assets/pdfs/The Public Domain - Enclosing the Commons of the Mind.pdf'\"\n   [textLayer]=\"true\" <!-- enable the find button -->\n   [showHandToolButton]=\"true\" <!-- enable text selection -->\n   [showPresentationModeButton]=\"true\"\n   [(page)]=\"page\"\n   [(pageLabel)]=\"pageLabel\">\n</ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```\n\n### TypeScript\n\n```typescript\n @Component({\n  selector: 'app-simple',\n  templateUrl: './simple.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./simple.component.css']\n})\nexport class SimpleComponent {\n  public page = 5;\n\n  public pageLabel: string;\n}\n```\n\n## Page and Page Label\n\nThe page is the number page number. It always starts with 1.\n\nThe page label is the page number assigned by the author of the PDF document. For example, the document below uses roman numbers for the table of contents and arabic numbers for the main body.\n\nIf you try to use both `[(page)]` and `[(pageLabel)]` with two-way binding, you'll run into `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedErrors`. To prevent this, you'll want to adopt the `OnPush` change detection strategy.\n\n### HTML\n\n```html\n<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n  [src]=\"'/assets/pdfs/The Public Domain - Enclosing the Commons of the Mind.pdf'\"\n  [theme]=\"theme\"\n>\n</ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```\n\n### TypeScript\n\n```typescript\n @Component({ ... })\nexport class SimpleComponent {\n  public set theme(theme: 'dark' || 'light') {\n    // this demo stores the theme in the local storage \n    // because it take on reload only\n    localStorage.setItem('ngx-extended-pdf-viewer.theme', theme);\n    location = location; // force reload\n  }\n\n  public get theme(): 'dark' || 'light' {\n    return localStorage.getItem('ngx-extended-pdf-viewer.theme') || 'light';\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Color Themes\n\nYou can choose between two predefined color themes, or you can provide your own custom color theme. Note that switching the themes doesn't work reliably without a full reload (i.e. hitting the F5 or CMD+R key). This demo reloads the page programmatically each time you change the theme.\n\n## Height\n\nIf you omit the [height] attribute, the PDF viewer tries to use all the available vertical space. To make this work, make sure the surrounding container is large enough to contain the PDF viewer. By default, many CSS frameworks set the height of an empty container to zero pixels. You can use the height attribute to work around this limitation or to fine-tune the amount of screen estate you need."

    "title": "Troubleshooting",

    "content": "### How to report issues and bugs\n\nIf there's any compatibility issue with an older version of Angular, please tell me on my [bugtracker](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues).\n\nTalking about bugs and feature requests: I also listen to StackOverflow, but it may take some time until I pick up bug reports from StackOverflow.\n\n## Modals and tabs (before version 22.3.0)\n\nPutting an `<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>` into a modal dialog or in a tab often causes timing problems. That always happens if the pdf viewer is part of the DOM, but invisible, as in these two examples:\n\nPrimeNG modal:\n\n```html\n<p-dialog header=\"PDF Viewer\" [modal]=\"true\" [(visible)]=\"showDialog\">\n  <ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]=\"'assets/Example.pdf'\"> </ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n></p-dialog>\n```\n\nMaterial Design tab:\n\n```html\n<mat-tab-group>\n  <mat-tab label=\"whatever\">\n    ...\n  </mat-tab>\n  <mat-tab label=\"PDF\">\n    <ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]=\"'assets/Example.pdf'\">\n  </mat-tab>\n</mat-tab-group>\n```\n\nAdd a short timeout. The idea is to show the PDF viewer with a short delay, so the modal has enough time to become visible before the PDF viewer initializes:\n\n```html\n@if (showViewer) { \n  <ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]=\"'assets/Example.pdf'\"> \n  </ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n} \n```\n\n```ts\n@Component({...})\npublic class PDFTabComponent {\n  public showViewer = false;\n\n  public onActivatePdfTab() {\n    setTimeout(() => this.showViewer = true, 100);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMost of these problems should be a thing of the past since version 22.3.0. You can drop the timeout, because ngx-extended-pdf-viewer now detects the issue and delays initialization internally. Note that this means it never initializes if the user doesn't open the modal or tab.\n\n## Modals - Exceptions on close\nIf the PDF viewer prints exceptions in the console log when closing the modal, you may want to call `ngOnDestroy()`\nmanually. <a href=\"/modal\">The demo on modals</a> demonstrates this approach.\n\n## Promise.allSettled is not a function\n\nPlease update the library `zone.js` to a current version. At the time of writing, that's 0.10.3. For some reason, the default setup of Angular locks `zone.js` to an old version. In most cases, the update shouldn't cause problems.\n\n## Running Angular in a context path or using a non-standard assets folder\n\nThe CMap files and the JavaScript files <code>pdf.min.js</code>, <code>viewer.min.js</code>, and <code>pdf.worker.min.js</code> are expected to be in the assets folder of your application.\nSometimes the path resolution fails. In this case, you'll need to set the default option <code>assetsFolder</code> to the appropriate value.\nMaybe you'll even have to modify the derived options <code>workerSrc</code> and <code>cMapUrl</code>.\n\nAnother workaround is to load the files <code>pdf.min.js</code> and <code>viewer.min.js</code> yourself. You just have to make sure that the files are loaded before ngx-extended-pdf-viewer is initialized. The drawback of this approach is that there's no automatic browser switch. ngx-extended-pdf-viewer detects the capabilities the user's browsers and selects either the slow-but-safe ECMAScript 5 version, or the faster default version that only runs on modern browsers.\n\nIn any case, you should not load the file <code>pdf.worker.min.js</code> yourself. Technically, that's possible, and the approach works well for small PDF files. But it ruins the performance of the PDF viewer. One of our <a href=\"https://www.obwb.ca/library/okanagan-basin-waterscape-poster/\">test PDF files (75 MB!)</a> shows almost immediately in the default configuration, but takes several minutes when your loading <code>pdf.worker.min.js</code> yourself. (The technical explanation is that loading the pdf worker file yourself disables the service worker).\n\n## I can't find the find button\n\nFirst of all, I have to apologize: For some reason, I've never managed to make the intuitive. I hope I'll manage one day or another!\n\nThe PDF viewer uses two layers of information. The first layer is what you see. That's simply an image. The second layer is the text layer. You need it to select text, and without the text layer you can't find anything. The \"find\" function can only cope with text, not with images.\n\nTo activate the \"find\" button you need a PDF file that contains text. A surprising number of PDF files are just images. If you've got such a PDF file, there's no find button. The PDF viewer doesn't include an OCR reader.\n\nSecond, you have to activate the attribute `textlayer`:\n\n```html\n<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n     [textLayer]=\"true\"  <!-- necessary to activate the find button and the select tool -->\n     [showHandToolButton]=\"true\" <!-- displays the \"select tool\" and the \"hand tool\" buttons -->\n     [src]=\"'/assets/pdfs/blind-text-collection.pdf'\"\n     [height]=\"'90vh'\">\n  </ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```\n\n## I can't select text\n\nThat's mostly the same as the trouble with the find button. Activate the text layer, set `[showHandToolButton]=\"true\"`, use a PDF file containing text, and you're good to go. That's an annoyingly long list of conditions. Sorry for that!\n\n## When I select or find text, the selection is slightly off\n\nThe text layer doesn't match the real positions of the text. It's a good approximation, but it's not perfect. More often than not, the selection is half a character off, sometimes even more. There's nothing you can do about it - except offering your help at the base project, <a target=\"#\" href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js\">pdf.js</a>. The project support almost every language and every font of the world, so it's hard to get it right.\n\n## Why is the text layer deactivated by default?\n\nThe PDF viewer is a lot faster if it doesn't have to render the text layer. That's why you have to activate the text layer manually.\n\n## Problems with Internet Explorer 11\n\nThe library is intended to be used with IE11 - but every once in a while, a new incompatibility pops up. Bear with me. I don't use Windows to develop the library, so testing IE11 isn't that easy.\n\nThe latest error I've seen is caused by another library, zone.js. Version 0.11.1 of zone.js is incompatible with IE11. If I've got it correctly, this will be fixed with version 0.11.2. What I can tell for sure is downgrading to version 0.10.3 fixes the bug. More details <a target=\"#\" href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38561\">in the GitHub ticket</a>.\n\n## iOS emulators; iOS 13 with ngx-extended-pdf-viewer 8.x\n\nThe base library, pdf.js, has begun to use advanced features of JavaScript with version 2.7. That corresponds with version 8.0 of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer. That's ok because pdf.js is the PDF viewer of Firefox - nothing less and nothing more - but it's a challenge for third-party library like ngx-extended-pdf-viewer. The solution is to use the ES5 version of pdf.js. ngx-extended-pdf-viewer tries to detect the features of your browser and to load the appropriate version of pdf.js.\n\nThere's a catch: starting with version 8.1.2, ngx-extended-pdf-viewer uses an algorithm that works fine on actual iPhones and iPads running on iOS 13.x, but if you're running the application in an emulator, it may report an unrecoverable error. Such as <a href=\"https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/657#issuecomment-783555261\">this error report shows</a>. If you run into such an error, test the code on a real device. Chances are it turns out to be a false positive.\n\nOh, and if you've got a better idea how to check compatibility, don't hesitate to <a href=\"https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues\">open a bug report</a>!\n\n## No PDF file shown - error message \"offsetParent not set - cannot scroll\" in the console\n\nThis error means that the PDF viewer is invisible at load time. For example, that happens frequently with modal windows. If there's a fade-in animation, there's a small time frame when the PDF viewer is still invisible. In this case, you need to add a small delay before initializing it.\n\nTwo solutions are sketched in the <a href=\"https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/489#issuecomment-703838087\">GitHub issues</a>:\n\n```typescript\nopenModal(modaltemplate: any): void {\n  modaltemplate.show();\n  setTimeout(() => this.stringSource = this.url, 50); // <<< added delay\n}\n```\n\nIf you're using Bootstrap, you can also use the event `(onshown)` like so:\n\n```html\n<div bsModal #pdfModal=\"bs-modal\" class=\"modal\" (onShown)=\"onModalShown($event)\"></div>\n```\n\n## Trouble with printing (aka: compatibility to Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks)\n\nProblems with printing are almost always problems of your CSS code. That doesn't necessarily mean you've done anything wrong.\nMost people run into this kind of trouble when using a CSS framework that hasn't been written with ngx-extended-pdf-viewer in mind.\nThat, in turn, is probably true for every CSS framework out there. The core library assumes there's no CSS framework at all.\nIt's the PDF viewer of Firefox, so that's a reasonable assumption.\n\nIf you wonder how CSS and printing are related: the thing is that the PDF viewer doesn't really print anything. It just hides the entire page using CSS and adds high-resolution images to the HTML document. After that, the PDF viewer simply calls the print function of your browser. Basically, it's printing the entire HTML page, including your Angular application. If everything works as intended, you don't notice because your Angular application is hidden.\n\nHowever, your custom CSS is still active. For example, if it reduces the font size, you end up with scaled-down pages in print.\n\nngx-extended-pdf-viewer covers several popular CSS frameworks (such as BootsFaces and Material Design), but it's still possible there's a conflict I haven't seen yet. If so, checking the `display` and `overflow` properties is a good starting point. Often adding this CSS snippet solves the problem:\n\n```css\n@media print {\n  #printContainer > div {\n    display: inline;\n    overflow-y: visible;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Empty pages when printing\n\nIf you find empty pages in your print, often adding these CSS rules to your global `styles.scss` helps:\n\n```css\n@media print {\n  #printContainer > .printedPage {\n    width: 99%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Hunting down other printing issues\n\nYou can debug print issues yourself. I've written detailed instructions here: <a href=\"https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/1431#issuecomment-1162091452\">https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/1431#issuecomment-1162091452</a>. When starting the\ndebugging session, you'll probably want to compare the CSS rules of your project with the reference project. You can either use the Angular schmetics\nto create a fresh project within a few minutes (see <a href=\"https://pdfviewer.net/extended-pdf-viewer/getting-started\">https://pdfviewer.net/extended-pdf-viewer/getting-started</a>), or you can use the <a href=\"https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html\">showcase of Mozilla's project</a>.\n\n### Possibly outdated hint: printing with Bootstrap\n\nAs far as I remember, I've managed to solve this bug for you. But if you're using an older version of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer, the bug might still hit you. Bootstrap interferes with the printing algorithm of `pdf.js`. Guard it with a media query to avoid unwanted effects, such as scaling the print to 65%. For example, if you're using SCSS and Bootstrap 4, remove the import of Bootstrap.min.css from the Angular.json file. Instead, import it by including Bootstrap by adding this line to the global `styles.scss` file:\n\n```css\n@media screen {\n  @import '../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';\n}\n```\n\nCaveat: this trick only works with the SCSS version of both `styles.scss` and `bootstrap.scss`. It doesn't work with simple CSS. If you're using pure CSS, you can use the solution suggested by <a href=\"https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/48#issuecomment-596629621\" target=\"#\">Austin Walker</a>:\n\n```css\n@media print {\n  body {\n    min-width: auto !important;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Dig deeper\n\nIf you need more information, have a look at these issues:\n\n- https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/148\n- https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/175\n- https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/143\n\n## Localization\n\nIf the PDF viewer doesn't show in your native language (or the language you're configured with the `[language]` attribute), please check the network tab and the settings in the Angular.json file. You must copy the folder `node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/locale` recursively to the folder `assets/locale`. If you only want to support a few language, you can reduce the size of the installation by omitting the other language files. However, that doesn't improve performance.\n\n## Multiple PDF viewers on the same page (e.g. tabs)\n\nUnfortunately, you can't use multiple instances of `<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>` on the same page. You're restricted to a single PDF viewer. This also applies to hidden PDF viewers. If you're using tabs containing PDF files, make sure you hide the PDF viewer before showing the next tab. You'll also need a short delay before showing the new PDF viewer. It takes some time to remove every object from memory.\n\n## Other hints collected over time\n\n| Error message or description                                            | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| sticky toolbar (when scrolling, the pdf file appears above the toolbar) | This happens if you're using the z-index to position the `<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>`. If you can't avoid to do so, add the global CSS rule `.body .toolbar { z-index: 0; }`. The PDF viewer works without the z-index of the toolbar. The only difference is that the shadow of the toolbar is hidden by the PDF document.                 |\n| Print also includes UI elements                                         | Usually, the entire screen is hidden automatically, but sometimes this fails, especially with widgets that are dynamically added, such as error messages, progress bars, and block UI overlays. Use media queries to hide the unwanted UI elements. For example, use something like `@media print { #modal-error-dialog: display none; }`. |\n\n# Hint referring to old versions of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n\nUsing the PDF viewer has become a lot simpler over time. However, if you're using a pre 2.0 version, or if you've got a non-standard configuration, these hints may be useful to you.\n\n## Loading the JS file in the wrong order\n\nHave a look at [this discussion](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues/20). Several developers observed it's a good idea to load the three pdf.js files before any other additional JavaScript file. Plus, they use each other, so they need to be defined in this order:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": [\n  \"node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf.js\",\n  \"node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/viewer.js\",\n  (put any additional JavaScript file here)\n]\n```\n\nThere's a third file - `node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/pdf.worker.js`. Earlier versions of these instructions told you to put add it in the `scripts` section, too, but that's wrong, as you'll see in the next paragraph.\n\n## Fake worker\n\nIf you see the message \"Setting up fake worker\", everything works fine, except you're wasting performance. To avoid that, make sure that the file `pdf.worker.js` (or `pdf.worker-es5.js` for developers supporting IE11) is _not_ part of the `scripts` section of the `angular.json`.\n\nInstead, put the pdf.worker.js file into the assets folder. The path can be configured in the global constant `defaultOptions.workerSrc` (which, in turn, is defined in the file `default-options.ts`). By default, it's './assets/pdf.worker.js'. In other words, you need to add these lines to the `angular.json`:\n\n```json\n\"assets\": [\n   ...,\n   {\n      \"glob\": \"pdf.worker.js\", // or \"pdf.worker-es5.js\" to support IE11\n      \"input\": \"node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets\",\n      \"output\": \"/assets/\"\n   }\n```\n\nIf you need IE11 support, you also need to configure the URL of the worker file:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defaultOptions } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';\n\n@Component(...)\nexport class PdfDisplayComponent {\nconstructor() {\n    defaultOptions.workerSrc = './assets/pdf.worker-es5.js';\n  }\n```\n\nIf everything works, the file is lazy-loaded when the PDF viewer opens, and you're rewarded with a non-blocking PDF viewer, even if your PDF file is huge.\n\n## set delayFirstView=\"1000\" (deprecated)\n\nThis workaround was needed in the early version of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer, before I understood how to initialize the library correctly. However, it may come in handy every once in a while. Sometimes the initialization of the pdf viewer takes some time, so the PDF file is opened too early. As a work-around, you can add a delay. Setting it to one second is usually a good compromise:\n\n```html\n<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer src=\"...\" [delayFirstView]=\"1000\"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```\n\n## \"Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responds with a MIME type of \"text/plain\"\n\nUpdate your server configuration. Many servers don't recognize `*.mjs` files as JavaScript. To fix this, you have to configure the server so it sends the file with the proper MIME type (`text/javascript`). You also have to configure the new i18n files. They've got the file ending `.ftl` and need the MIME type `text/plain`.\n\nFor example, IIS requires this configuration:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<configuration>\n\n  <system.webServer>\n  <staticContent>\n    <mimeMap fileExtension=\".mjs\" mimeType=\"text/javascript\" />\n    <mimeMap fileExtension=\".ftl\" mimeType=\"text/plain\" />\n  </staticContent>\n  </system.webServer>\n\n</configuration>\n```\n\nnginx requires this configuration:\n\n```nginx\nlocation / {\n    ...\n\n    location ~* \\.mjs$ {\n                # target only *.mjs files\n                # now we can safely override types since we are only\n                # targeting a single file extension.\n                types {\n                    text/javascript mjs;\n                }\n            }\n  }\n```\n\nAWS amplify requires this configuration in the `amplify.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ncustomHeaders:\n  - pattern: '*.mjs'\n    headers:\n      - key: 'Content-Type'\n        value: 'application/javascript'\n```"

If you're using two-way binding, the variable is updated\nwhen the user zooms in or out.\n\n## Huge Zoom Levels\n\nIf the resolution of the PDF is very high, the PDF viewer calculates the maximum canvas size. If the canvas size exceeds the maximum canvas size, `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` reduces the resolution and activates CSS scaling. On most devices and with most PDF documents, this probably never happens.\n\nYou can trade performance for blurriness by limiting the maximum canvas size by setting `pdfDefaultOptions.maxCanvasPixels` in the constructor.\n\nHere's a [list of the maximum canvas sizes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-size#test-results) on many browsers and devices.\n\nIf you exceed this setting, or if the necessary canvas size is larger than `pdfDefaultOptions.maxCanvasPixels` defines, `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` limits the canvas size and activates CSS scaling. So you can get higher zoom levels, but the text may be blurry.\n\n## HTML\n\n```html\n<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer\n  [src]=\"'/assets/pdfs/BootsFaces_Deep_Dive_1.0.pdf'\"\n  (currentZoomFactor)=\"updateZoomFactor($event)\"\n  [height]=\"'90vh'\"\n  [(zoom)]=\"zoomSetting\"\n  [minZoom]=\"minZoom\" [maxZoom]=\"maxZoom\"\n  [zoomLevels]=\"zoomLevels\"\n  >\n</ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\n```typescript\n@Component({\nstandalone: false,  ... })\nexport class ZoomComponent {\n  public isMobile = 'ontouchstart' in document.documentElement;\n  public minZoom = 0.33;\n  public maxZoom = 3;\n  public zoomLevels = ['auto', 'page-actual', 'page-fit', 'page-width', 0.2, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4];\n  private _zoomSetting: number | string | undefined = 'page-width';\n  private currentZoomFactor: number;\n\n  public get zoomSetting() {\n    return String(this._zoomSetting);\n  }\n  public set zoomSetting(zoom: string) {\n    if (isNaN(Number(zoom))) {\n      this._zoomSetting = zoom;\n    } else {\n      this._zoomSetting = zoom + '%';\n    }\n  }\n  public updateZoomFactor(zoom: number): void {\n    this.currentZoomFactor = zoom;\n  }\n}\n```"
