## 🚀 Getting Started

### 0. Prerequisites

⚠️ **Version 26 requires Angular 19.** If you're using Angular 17 or 18, please continue using version 25.6.4 or earlier.

**Why this breaking change?** Angular 18 exited its Long-Term Support (LTS) phase, and security vulnerability CVE-2025-66035 will not be fixed in Angular 17 or 18. Updating to Angular 19 ensures your application continues to receive critical security patches.

In general, I aim to support the last four Angular versions (roughly two years of updates), but this may not always be feasible. Security requirements sometimes necessitate raising the minimum Angular version. You can't have an omelette without breaking an egg.

✅ **Angular 21+ Zoneless Support**

**ngx-extended-pdf-viewer now fully supports Angular 21+ zoneless change detection!** The library works seamlessly in both zone.js and zoneless applications with zero configuration required.

**Using Zoneless (Default in Angular 21+):**
Simply use the library as normal - it will automatically detect zoneless mode and trigger change detection appropriately.

**Using Zone.js (Optional):**
If you prefer to use zone.js in your Angular 21+ application, add this to your `app.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { provideZoneChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),
    // ... other providers
  ],
};
```

Both modes are fully supported with the same API and features. See the [changelog](./changelog.md) for details on the zoneless implementation.

### 1. Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm add ngx-extended-pdf-viewer
```

### 2. Usage in Your Angular Component

In your component HTML:

```html
<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]="'assets/example.pdf'"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>
```

**For NgModule-based applications:**

```ts
import { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**For standalone components (Angular 17+):**

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-pdf-viewer',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule],
  template: `<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]="'assets/example.pdf'"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>`,
})
export class PdfViewerComponent {}
```

**Or configure in main.ts for application-wide availability:**

```ts
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { importProvidersFrom } from '@angular/core';
import { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    importProvidersFrom(NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule),
    // other providers...
  ],
});
```

## 🔐 Security Notice

Don't be bothered by the flood of alpha versions in 25.6.0. I know that's considered a warning signal of a Shai Hulud infection. However, in this particular case, it was the exact opposite: adding protection against Shai Hulud and migrating from traditional publishing to publishing as a trusted publisher with provenance didn't work immediately. It "burned" 20 version numbers until I finally found the correct configuration.

Version `20.0.2` fixes a critical security vulnerability (CVE-2024-4367). Update to this version or newer to stay safe from exploits via malicious PDF files.

Thanks to GitHub users ScratchPDX and Deepak Shakya for reporting the issue promptly.

## 📣 Roadmap Highlights

### Version 26

**Breaking Change: Angular 19 Required**

Version 26 updates to Angular 19 to address security concerns. Angular 18 exited its LTS phase, and CVE-2025-66035 will not be fixed in Angular 17 or 18.

**What's included:**

- Updated to Angular 19 with all components explicitly set to `standalone: false` for NgModule compatibility
- Fixed findbar layout (#3105) - dropped old checkboxes for better responsive design

**Migration:**

- If using Angular 17 or 18, stay on version 25.6.4 or earlier
- To update your application to Angular 19: `ng update @angular/core@19 @angular/cli@19`

**Future roadmap** (originally planned for version 25, postponed due to this breaking change):

- Migration to Angular Signals
- Full support for standalone components
- Removal of `zone.js` (maybe)
- Migration schematics (planned but not promised)

## 📦 Version Highlights

### Version 25

#### ❗ License change notice

The license has changed from Apache 2.0 to Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause, which allows free use, modification, and distribution while preventing commercial sale or paid services without permission. You can still use ngx-extended-pdf-viewer in your commercial or closed-source products, and you can distribute it with your software, provided you keep the copyright notice intact.
For the exact terms, please refer to the LICENSE file — that is the legally binding document.

#### ❗ Breaking changes:

- Version 25.5.0: if you omit the attribute `[page]` or `[zoom]` and if the PDF viewer opens a PDF document for the second time, the PDF opens on the same page and with the same zoom setting it had before. Before version 25.5.0, the PDF would always open at page 1 and with `zoom = pdfDefaultOptions.defaultZoomValue` (which usually is `'auto'`). I think that's a mildly breaking change, so I raised the version number to 25.5.0.
- The default background color of PDF files has changed from `#E8E8EB` to `#FFFFFF`.
- Embedded JavaScript is now an opt-in feature. It's no longer enabled by default. You can enable it with three feature toggles:
  - `pdfDefaultOptions.enableScripting` — main toggle. Set it to true to allow execution of embedded JavaScript.
  - `pdfDefaultOptions.enableOpenActionJavaScript` — allows JavaScript that runs when opening a PDF file. Requires `pdfDefaultOptions.enableScripting = true`.
  - `pdfDefaultOptions.enableCatalogAAJavaScript` — allows JavaScript that runs when printing, saving, or closing a PDF file. Requires `pdfDefaultOptions.enableScripting = true`.

Security note: Embedded JavaScript in PDFs runs inside a sandboxed JavaScript interpreter (written in C and transpiled to JavaScript) and does not use functions like eval(). These measures reduce — but do not eliminate — potential security risks. For that reason, all related options are disabled by default, and enabling them is at your own risk. While these features can be useful, be aware that no software can guarantee complete protection against malicious content.

### Version 24

- Version 24.3.0 adds a dark mode. Thanks to Megan Truso for providing the pull request!
- Version 24.2.0 and above:
  - **Showcase Application Modernization**: The showcase application has been converted to standalone components, demonstrating modern Angular patterns and best practices for integration.
  - **Page Reordering Feature**: New `enablePageReordering` option allows users to reorder PDF pages by dragging thumbnails. Enable it with `pdfDefaultOptions.enablePageReordering = true;`.
  - **Translations of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer extensions**: I had my AI translate the labels of the buttons to 20 European languages. That's an experiment. If it works well, I'll add translations for all 112 languages supported by pdf.js. But let's start small - I don't speak non-European languages, which means I can't verify the AI generates the correct translation!

- Version 24.1.0 and above: improved accessibility by showing a hover effect when the mouse is over a button and by adding a blue ring to the active element, thus restoring the implementation we used to have a long time ago. Thanks to Megan for contributing this pull request!

Version 24.0.0:

- Upgraded to `pdf.js 5.3`
- Minor breaking change: Every Acroform field with the same name is now updated by the two-way binding `[(formData)]`. In earlier versions, only the first field was changed. Kudos to Sebastien Fauvart for submitting this pull request!
- There's a new "signature editor". Disabled by default, you can opt in with `pdfDefaultOptions.enableSignatureEditor = true;`. Caveat: these signatures are not cryptographic PDF signatures. At the time of writing (July 07, 2025), they're merely "stamp annotations".

### Version 23

- Popup dialog positioning via JavaScript
- Option to force JavaScript code reload
- Improved mobile stability (reduced canvas resolution)
- Ink editor API updated (breaking change)
- Dialog CSS selectors adjusted for theming

❗ Version 23 includes a CSS bug where search highlights may render text invisible. To work around this, add the following to your global `styles.css`:

```css
ngx-extended-pdf-viewer .textLayer .highlight.selected {
  opacity: 0.25;
}
```

Remove this workaround after updating to 24.0.0+.

## 🕰️ Need a Fix for an Older Version?

I understand, but... realistically, I can’t maintain old versions in my spare time. The architecture allows for it, but I simply don’t have the bandwidth — unless something critical breaks.

If you're desperate for a fix or a new feature, there’s one option: ask my employer. I work as an IT consultant, and they may be willing to sponsor time to work on ngx-extended-pdf-viewer during business hours.

## 🧓 Internet Explorer 11 Support

Still using IE11 in 2025? You're braver than most.

I hate to admit it - but I've dropped support years ago. The last known compatible version is 5.3. Use it at your own risk — no updates, no fixes, no guarantees.
