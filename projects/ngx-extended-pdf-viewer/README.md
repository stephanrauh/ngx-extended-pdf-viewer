# ngx-extended-pdf-viewer

Welcome to `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` – a powerful, full-featured PDF viewer for Angular applications. Whether you're building enterprise tools or internal utilities, this library gives you the control and customization options you need, all while preserving a native-like viewing experience.

Built on Mozilla’s pdf.js and extended with dozens of enhancements, it's ideal for serious applications that demand more than just basic PDF display.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 0. Prerequisites

The library requires Angular 17+. Older versions are not supported.

In general, I aim to support the last four Angular versions (roughly two years of updates), but this may not always be feasible. For example, the upcoming version 25 might raise the minimum required Angular version significantly: I plan to support modern Angular (and I know many of you are waiting for that). You can't have an omelette without breaking an egg.

### 1. Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm add ngx-extended-pdf-viewer
```

### 2. Usage in Your Angular Component

In your component HTML:

```html
<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]="'assets/example.pdf'"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>
```

**For NgModule-based applications:**

```ts
import { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**For standalone components (Angular 17+):**

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-pdf-viewer',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule],
  template: `<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]="'assets/example.pdf'"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>`,
})
export class PdfViewerComponent {}
```

**Or configure in main.ts for application-wide availability:**

```ts
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { importProvidersFrom } from '@angular/core';
import { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    importProvidersFrom(NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule),
    // other providers...
  ],
});
```

## 🔐 Security Notice

Version `20.0.2` fixes a critical security vulnerability (CVE-2024-4367). Update to this version or newer to stay safe from exploits via malicious PDF files.

Thanks to GitHub users ScratchPDX and Deepak Shakya for reporting the issue promptly.

---

## 📣 Roadmap Highlights

### Upcoming in Version 26

Originally, these features where announced for version 25. But an unexpected breaking changed forced me to add an intermediate major version.

- Migration to Angular Signals
- Support for standalone components
- Removal of `zone.js` (maybe)
- Migration schematics planned (but not promised)

Expect some breaking changes — but better performance and modern Angular support await!

Regarding security: I'm not perfect - it's always a best-effort approach without guarantees. I'm 100% committed, but I need your help, and even so, in the long run, errors are invevitable. The art is to close vulnerabilities before a hacker can exploit then - and that's a joint effort. Together, we'll manage. Don't hesitate to report bugs and vulnerabilities as soon as possible!

## 📦 Version Highlights

### Version 25

Embedded JavaScript now is an opt-in feature. You can activate it with three feature toggles:

- `pdfDefaultOptions.enableScripting` is the main toggle. Set it to true to activate JavaScript.
- `pdfDefaultOptions.enableOpenActionJavaScript` enables JavaScript that runs when opening a PDF file. Note that this flag also requires you to set `pdfDefaultOptions.enableScripting = true`.
- `pdfDefaultOptions.enableCatalogAAJavaScript` enables JavaScript that runs when printing, saving or closing a PDF file. Note that this flag also requires you to set `pdfDefaultOptions.enableScripting = true`.

Contrary to public belief, executing embedded JavaScript shouldn't be a security risk. Hackers are clever, so there's no guarantee, and that's why I've deactivated embedded JavaScript by default and added fine-grained feature toggles. That said, embedded JavaScript runs in a sandbox which is a JavaScript interpreter written in C and transpiled to JavaScript. It does not use a risky function like `eval()`. Nonetheless, setting the defaults to `false` makes sense because the library is written and maintained by fallible humans.

### Version 24

- Version 24.3.0 adds a dark mode. Thanks to Megan Truso for providing the pull request!
- Version 24.2.0 and above:
  - **Showcase Application Modernization**: The showcase application has been converted to standalone components, demonstrating modern Angular patterns and best practices for integration.
  - **Page Reordering Feature**: New `enablePageReordering` option allows users to reorder PDF pages by dragging thumbnails. Enable it with `pdfDefaultOptions.enablePageReordering = true;`.
  - **Translations of ngx-extendeded-pdf-viewer extensions**: I had my AI translate the labels of the buttons to 20 European languages. That's an experiment. If it works well, I'll add translations for all 112 languages supported by pdf.js. But let's start small - I don't speak non-European languages, which means I can't verify the AI generates the correct translation!

- Version 24.1.0 and above: improved accessability by showing a hover effect when the mouse is over a button and by adding a blue ring to the active element, thus restoring the implementation we used to have a long time ago. Thanks to Megan for contributing this pull request!

Version 24.0.0:

- Upgraded to `pdf.js 5.3`
- Minor breaking change: Every Acroform field with the same name is now updated by the two-way binding `[(formData)]`. In earlier versions, only the first field was changed. Kudos to Sebastien Fauvart for submitting this pull request!
- There a new "signature editor". Disabled by default, you can opt in with `pdfDefaultOptions.enableSignatureEditor = true;`. Caveat: these signature are not cyptographic PDF signatures. At the time of writing (July 07, 2025), they're merely "stamp annotations".

### Version 23

- Popup dialog positioning via JavaScript
- Option to force JavaScript code reload
- Improved mobile stability (reduced canvas resolution)
- Ink editor API updated (breaking change)
- Dialog CSS selectors adjusted for theming

❗ Version 23 includes a CSS bug where search highlights may render text invisible. To work around this, add the following to your global `styles.css`:

```css
ngx-extended-pdf-viewer .textLayer .highlight.selected {
  opacity: 0.25;
}
```

Remove this workaround after updating to 24.0.0+.

## 🕰️ Need a Fix for an Older Version?

I understand, but... realistically, I can’t maintain old versions in my spare time. The architecture allows for it, but I simply don’t have the bandwidth — unless something critical breaks.

If you're desperate for a fix or a new feature, there’s one option: ask my employer. I work as an IT consultant, and they may be willing to sponsor time to work on ngx-extended-pdf-viewer during business hours.

## 💡 Alternatives

If this library doesn't fit your needs:

- [`ng2-pdf-viewer`](https://github.com/vadimdez/ng2-pdf-viewer): Minimal and lightweight
- [`ng2-pdfjs-viewer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdfjs-viewer): iframe-based, supports multiple PDFs
- Native browser PDF viewer: Fast, but limited customization

## 🧓 Internet Explorer 11 Support

Still using IE11 in 2025? You're braver than most.

I hate to admit it - but I've dropped support years ago. The last known compatible version is 5.3. Use it at your own risk — no updates, no fixes, no guarantees.
