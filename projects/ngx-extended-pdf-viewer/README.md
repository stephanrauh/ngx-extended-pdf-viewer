# ngx-extended-pdf-viewer

Welcome to `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` ‚Äì a powerful, full-featured PDF viewer for Angular applications. Whether you're building enterprise tools or internal utilities, this library gives you the control and customization options you need, all while preserving a native-like viewing experience.

Built on Mozilla‚Äôs pdf.js and extended with dozens of enhancements, it's ideal for serious applications that demand more than just basic PDF display.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 0. Prerequisites

The library requires Angular 17+. Older versions are not supported.

In general, I aim to support the last four Angular versions (roughly two years of updates), but this may not always be feasible. For example, the upcoming version 26 might raise the minimum required Angular version significantly: I plan to support modern Angular (and I know many of you are waiting for that). You can't have an omelette without breaking an egg.

### 1. Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm add ngx-extended-pdf-viewer
```

### 2. Usage in Your Angular Component

In your component HTML:

```html
<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]="'assets/example.pdf'"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>
```

**For NgModule-based applications:**

```ts
import { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**For standalone components (Angular 17+):**

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-pdf-viewer',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule],
  template: `<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]="'assets/example.pdf'"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>`,
})
export class PdfViewerComponent {}
```

**Or configure in main.ts for application-wide availability:**

```ts
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { importProvidersFrom } from '@angular/core';
import { NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule } from 'ngx-extended-pdf-viewer';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    importProvidersFrom(NgxExtendedPdfViewerModule),
    // other providers...
  ],
});
```

## üîê Security Notice

Version `20.0.2` fixes a critical security vulnerability (CVE-2024-4367). Update to this version or newer to stay safe from exploits via malicious PDF files.

Thanks to GitHub users ScratchPDX and Deepak Shakya for reporting the issue promptly.

## üì£ Roadmap Highlights

### Upcoming in Version 26

Originally, these features where announced for version 25. But an unexpected breaking changed forced me to add an intermediate major version.

- Migration to Angular Signals
- Support for standalone components
- Removal of `zone.js` (maybe)
- Migration schematics planned (but not promised)

Expect some breaking changes ‚Äî but better performance and modern Angular support await!

The art is to close vulnerabilities before a hacker can exploit then - and that's a joint effort. Together, we'll manage. Don't hesitate to report bugs and vulnerabilities as soon as possible!

## üì¶ Version Highlights

### Version 25

#### ‚ùó License change notice

The license has changed from Apache 2.0 to Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause, which allows free use, modification, and distribution while preventing commercial sale or paid services without permission. You can still use ngx-extended-pdf-viewer in your commercial or closed-source products, and you can distribute it with your software, provided you keep the copyright notice intact.
For the exact terms, please refer to the LICENSE file ‚Äî that is the legally binding document.

#### ‚ùó Breaking changes:

- Version 25.5.0: if you omit the attribute `[page]` or `[zoom]` and if the PDF viewer opens a PDF document for the second time, the PDF opens on the same page and with the same zoom setting it had before. Before version 25.5.0, the PDF would always open at page 1 and with `zoom = pdfDefaultOptions.defaultZoomValue` (which usually is `'auto'`). I think that's a mildly breaking change, so I raised the version number to 25.5.0.
- The default background color of PDF files has changed from `#E8E8EB` to `#FFFFFF`.
- Embedded JavaScript is now an opt-in feature. It's no longer enabled by default. You can enable it with three feature toggles:
  - `pdfDefaultOptions.enableScripting` ‚Äî main toggle. Set it to true to allow execution of embedded JavaScript.
  - `pdfDefaultOptions.enableOpenActionJavaScript` ‚Äî allows JavaScript that runs when opening a PDF file. Requires `pdfDefaultOptions.enableScripting = true`.
  - `pdfDefaultOptions.enableCatalogAAJavaScript` ‚Äî allows JavaScript that runs when printing, saving, or closing a PDF file. Requires `pdfDefaultOptions.enableScripting = true`.

Security note: Embedded JavaScript in PDFs runs inside a sandboxed JavaScript interpreter (written in C and transpiled to JavaScript) and does not use functions like eval(). These measures reduce ‚Äî but do not eliminate ‚Äî potential security risks. For that reason, all related options are disabled by default, and enabling them is at your own risk. While these features can be useful, be aware that no software can guarantee complete protection against malicious content.

### Version 24

- Version 24.3.0 adds a dark mode. Thanks to Megan Truso for providing the pull request!
- Version 24.2.0 and above:
  - **Showcase Application Modernization**: The showcase application has been converted to standalone components, demonstrating modern Angular patterns and best practices for integration.
  - **Page Reordering Feature**: New `enablePageReordering` option allows users to reorder PDF pages by dragging thumbnails. Enable it with `pdfDefaultOptions.enablePageReordering = true;`.
  - **Translations of ngx-extendeded-pdf-viewer extensions**: I had my AI translate the labels of the buttons to 20 European languages. That's an experiment. If it works well, I'll add translations for all 112 languages supported by pdf.js. But let's start small - I don't speak non-European languages, which means I can't verify the AI generates the correct translation!

- Version 24.1.0 and above: improved accessability by showing a hover effect when the mouse is over a button and by adding a blue ring to the active element, thus restoring the implementation we used to have a long time ago. Thanks to Megan for contributing this pull request!

Version 24.0.0:

- Upgraded to `pdf.js 5.3`
- Minor breaking change: Every Acroform field with the same name is now updated by the two-way binding `[(formData)]`. In earlier versions, only the first field was changed. Kudos to Sebastien Fauvart for submitting this pull request!
- There a new "signature editor". Disabled by default, you can opt in with `pdfDefaultOptions.enableSignatureEditor = true;`. Caveat: these signature are not cyptographic PDF signatures. At the time of writing (July 07, 2025), they're merely "stamp annotations".

### Version 23

- Popup dialog positioning via JavaScript
- Option to force JavaScript code reload
- Improved mobile stability (reduced canvas resolution)
- Ink editor API updated (breaking change)
- Dialog CSS selectors adjusted for theming

‚ùó Version 23 includes a CSS bug where search highlights may render text invisible. To work around this, add the following to your global `styles.css`:

```css
ngx-extended-pdf-viewer .textLayer .highlight.selected {
  opacity: 0.25;
}
```

Remove this workaround after updating to 24.0.0+.

## üï∞Ô∏è Need a Fix for an Older Version?

I understand, but... realistically, I can‚Äôt maintain old versions in my spare time. The architecture allows for it, but I simply don‚Äôt have the bandwidth ‚Äî unless something critical breaks.

If you're desperate for a fix or a new feature, there‚Äôs one option: ask my employer. I work as an IT consultant, and they may be willing to sponsor time to work on ngx-extended-pdf-viewer during business hours.

- [`ng2-pdf-viewer`](https://github.com/vadimdez/ng2-pdf-viewer): Minimal and lightweight
- [`ng2-pdfjs-viewer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdfjs-viewer): iframe-based, supports multiple PDFs
- Native browser PDF viewer: Fast, but limited customization

## üßì Internet Explorer 11 Support

Still using IE11 in 2025? You're braver than most.

I hate to admit it - but I've dropped support years ago. The last known compatible version is 5.3. Use it at your own risk ‚Äî no updates, no fixes, no guarantees.
