## What's new in version 5.0?

Version 5.0 updates to pdf.js 2.6.347. In a nutshell, this means supports for layers and forms. Version 5.0 also brings support for color themes.


## Breaking changes
With version 5.0, I've radically simplified the CSS code and some of the HTML code. Almost all the shadows, focus styles, and hover styles are gone. I hope that doesn't break any real-world application, but if you've customized the CSS code of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer deeply, expect breaking changes.

`showSecondaryToolbarButton` did exactly the opposite of what it was meant to do. If you're relying on this bug (or simply inverted the boolean value as a workaround), the bug fix breaks your code.

There are also minor changes to the UI. I've replaced several icons by SVG graphics to make theming easier.

As mentioned above, version 5.0 also updates to pdf.js 2.6.347. It's unlikely, but that may be a breaking change to some applications, too.

## Showcase and manual

There's a showcase at <a href="https://pdfviewer.net">https://pdfviewer.net</a>. Check this page for live demos, source code examples, and a handbook.

## Bringing PDF to the Angular world

This library provides an embeddable PDF viewer component. It's different from other approaches like [ng2-pdf-viewer](https://vadimdez.github.io/ng2-pdf-viewer/) in that it shows the full suite of UI widgets. In other words, it strongly resembles the PDF viewer of your browser:

## Features

- Support for Internet Explorer 11
- Searching (including a programmatic API)
- Printing
- Support for forms
- (Limited) support for signatures (lacking verification of the signature, so use on your own risk!)
- Sidebar with thumbnails, outlines, and attachments (and each of them both optional and customizable)
- Rotating
- Download (including form data) and upload
- Zoom (with optional two-way binding to an attribute)
- Full-screen mode
- Various selection tools
- Standard display or even / odd spreads (like a book)
- Multiple event listeners
- Several approaches to scrolling (vertical, horizontal, "wrapped" scrolling)
- Internationalization (providing translations to several dozen languages)
- Direct access to the core API of pdf.js (including TypeScript definition files)
- The ability to deactivate (i.e. hide) every button, menu item, and the context menu
- Color theming
- And to customize the toolbars and menus according to your needs.

Not to mention the ability to display PDF files, running on Mozilla's pdf.js 2.6.347, released in March 2020. If you're the daring one, you can also use the developer version 2.7. It's bleeding edge, so use it at own risk. Basically, this preview is there to make the update easier when a Mozilla publishes a new version of their pdf.js library.


## Alternatives
<details>
  <summary><b>Expand to learn more about the other options to display PDF files in Angular</b></summary>
  If you only need the base functionality, I'll happily pass you to <a href="https://github.com/vadimdez/ng2-pdf-viewer/" target="#">the project of Vadym Yatsyuk</a>. Vadym does a great job delivering a no-nonsense PDF viewer. However, if you need something that can easily pass as the native viewer on a gloomy day, ngx-extended-pdf-viewer is your friend.

There's also a direct counterpart to my library: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdfjs-viewer" target="#">ng2-pdfjs-viewer</a>. As far as I can see, it's also a good library. Recently (May 24, 2019), it has been updated to PDF.js 2.2.171. It wraps the PDF viewer in an iFrame. That's a more reliable approach, but it also offers fewer options. The list of attributes is shorter, and the PDF viewer can't emit events to your application. If you're not happy with my library, check out ng2-pdfjs-viewer. It's a good library, too. Its unique selling point is displaying multiple PDF files simultaneously on the same page.

You might also try to use the native PDF viewer of your browser. That's a valid approach. It's even the preferred approach. The advantages of both `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` and `ng2-pdfjs-viewer` are they also support Internet Explorer 11 (with some help of the polyfills). `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer` also gives you a wide range of options that aren't available using the native API.

## How to use the library
As a rule of thumb, I recommend cloning the [showcase project from GitHub](https://github.com/stephanrauh/extended-pdf-viewer-showcase) before doing anything else. It's a standard Angular CLI application, so you'll get it up and running in less than ten minutes. It's a good starting point to do your own experiments. Maybe even more important: you'll learn if the library works on your machine. (Of course, it does, but it's always good to double-check!)

The detailed instructions for JHipster and Angular 2, 4, and 5 are available [on the showcase](https://pdfviewer.net/getting-started).

1.  Install the library with `npm i ngx-extended-pdf-viewer --save`
    
2. Open the file `angular.json` (or `.angular-cli.json` if you're using an older version of Angular) and configure Angular to copy the `assets` folder of the library into the `assets` folder of your application:
  ```json
    "assets": [
      "src/favicon.ico",
      "src/assets",
      {
        "glob": "**/*",
        "input": "node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/",
        "output": "/assets/"
      }
    ],
    "scripts": []
  ```
 This simply copies the entire assets folder. If you're concerned about disk memory, you can omit the subfolders `inline-locale-files` and `additional-locale`. If you need only one language, you can reduce the list to `locale.properties` and your language folder.

 If you want to use the developer preview of pdf.js 2.7, import the "bleeding edge" files instead:

  ```json
  "assets": [
    "src/favicon.ico",
    "src/assets",
    {
      "glob": "**/*",
      "input": "node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/bleeding-edge/",
      "output": "/assets/"
    }
  ],
  "scripts": []
  ```

  _Hint:_ There are two ways to define the language files needed for the labels of the buttons and screen elements. The second method is described below in the "internationalization" section.

3.  Now you can display the PDF file like so:
  ```html
  <ngx-extended-pdf-viewer [src]="'assets/example.pdf'" useBrowserLocale="true" height="80vh"></ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>
  ```

4. If you want to display a PDF file you have downloaded from a server, you probably have a `Blob` or a Base64 encoded string. `Blobs` can be passed directly to the attribute `[src]`. Base64 string must be passed to the attribute `[base64Src]` instead.



## Configuration
Do you miss a configuration option? File an issue on the [project bug tracker](https://github.com/stephanrauh/ExploringAngular/tree/master/embedding-pdf). If the base library [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) supports the requested option, I'll probably add it. BTW, you can speed up the process by providing a code snippet telling me how to implement the feature or by submitting a pull request.

_Legend:_

- [(attribute)] describes an attribute with two-way-binding
- [attribute] means that PDF-viewer reacts when the attribute changes
- (attribute) means an event is raised when the user changes a setting
- attribute (without special characters) means the attribute is used at load time only. Subsequent changes are ignored.

Also see [the attribute list on the showcase](https://pdfviewer.net/attributes). It's the same list, just a little more useful because the showcase doesn't truncate the table on the right-hand side.

| _Attribute_                  | _default value_ | _description_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| [(src)]                      |                 | If `[src]` is a string: defines the URL of the PDF file to display. `src` may also be a `Blob`, a `Uint8Array` or an `ArrayBuffer`. To a limited extend, `[(src)]` is also a two-way binding attribute. If the user opens another PDF file, the event (srcChange) is fire. There's a catch: for security reasons, most browsers don't display the correct filename. Most often than not, the path is `C:\fakepath\`. The (srcChange) event removes the fakepath bit of the path. The $event attribute is simply the filename. But don't rely on it: it's up to the browser to implement that feature, and if you add the page to the "trusted pages" list in the Internet Explorer, the fully qualified file name is provided.                                                                     |

This event seems to fire often enough to make it reliable for detecting the current zoom factor all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| delayFirstView               |        0        | Number of milliseconds to wait between initializing the PDF viewer and loading the PDF file. Most users can let this parameter safely at it's default value of zero.

You can also use this event to detect when a document has been loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| (pageRendered)               |    undefined    | fires each time a page is rendered. Emits an instance of `PageRenderedEvent`.

| pageViewMode               |    multiple    | `pageViewMode="multiple"` is the default PDF viewer. It shows the entire PDF files as a long roll of pages, just as Acrobat reader does. `pageViewMode="single"` only displays one page at a time. You can't scroll to the next page. The only way to navigate to another page is to click on the "next page/previous page" button, enter a page number, jump to the next result of a search, and to click on an entry of the table of contents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This, in turn, enables marking text and highlighting search result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [(zoom)]                     |    undefined    | `[zoom]="undefined"` (default value): use the zoom level `"auto"`. If not `undefined`: Set the zoom level of the page, no matter which zoom level was previously configured. Legal values are `[zoom]="'auto'"`, `'page-actual'"`, `"'page-fit'"`, `"'page-width'"`, `"50%"`, or `50` (or any other numeric value). Numbers are always considered percentages; the trailing "%" character is optional. This attribute supports two-way binding. `[(zoom)]="zoomAttribute"` updates the variable `zoomAttribute` each time the user changes the zoom setting. This is useful to use the same zoom across multiple PDF viewer instances or PDF document. If you're only interested in the event, that's `(zoomChange)`, described in some more detail below.                                         |
| (zoomChange)                 |    undefined    | `(zoomChange)` is intended to fire when the user changes the zoom setting. If the zoom setting because of a different reason, such as resizing the window, the event should not fire. That's the difference to `(currentZoomFactor)`, which fires on every zoom event. In practice, it's a bit difficult to distinguish the two types of events, so chances are `(zoomChange)` fires too often or too seldom. However, when it fires, it fires a numeric value, basically the percentage without the percent character. It never fires when the zoom dropdown is set to `[zoom]="'auto'"`, `'page-actual'"`, `"'page-fit'"` or `"'page-width'"`. That also applies if it was the user who changed the dropdown. Putting it in simpler words: the event is not fired if the zoom is a string value. |

## Searching programmatically

The service `NgxExtendedPdfViewerService` allows you to search programmatically. If the PDF viewer hasn't been initialized, or if it has already been destroyed, calling the service results in an error message on the console.

| _method_                     | action                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `find(text: string):boolean` | finds a certain text. If the PDF viewer is not initialized, the method returns `false` and prints an error message on the console.                                                        |
| `findNext(): boolean`        | finds the next search result. Only call it after calling `find()` first. If the PDF viewer is not initialized, the method returns `false` and prints an error message on the console.     |
| `findPrevious(): boolean`    | finds the previous search result. Only call it after calling `find()` first. If the PDF viewer is not initialized, the method returns `false` and prints an error message on the console. |

## Internationalization

### Slow default way

If you add the translation files to your project as described above in step 3, the PDF viewer uses the browser language setting to determine which language to load. First, it loads the `locale.properties`, scans it for the desired language files, and loads the language file from the corresponding folder. That's two additional HTTP calls. That's slow, and it may even lead to errors if the network is already congested loading other resource files.

Don't forget to set the attribute `useBrowserLocale="true"` if you follow this approach.

### Slow way with custom translation files

If you want to use the slow way, but prefer to load the language files from a different URL, add a link to your application like so:

```html
<link rel="resource" type="application/l10n" href="https://www.example.com/locale/locale.properties" />
```

In this case, don't set `useBrowserLocale` (or set it explicitly to false).

### Inlining (aka embedding) the language files

Alternatively, you can provide the translations as a Json file. This Json file has to be part of an HTML page. That's especially useful if you need only one or two languages, because the are loaded a lot faster. To get familiar with this approach, embed the Json file in the `index.html` like so:

```html
<script type="application/l10n">
  {"default_locale":"de","locales":{"de": ... }}
</script>
```

The folder `node_modules/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/assets/inline-locale-files` contains snippet files you can simply copy into your HTML page.

_Hint_: You can also add the language definition in another HTML file. The bottom line is that the HTML snippet is already part of the DOM when the PDF viewer is initialized. Cluttering the root index file with the translations is an ugly and inflexible hack, but it works.

If you're using the "inline" approach, don't set `useBrowserLocale` (or set it explicitly to `false`).
