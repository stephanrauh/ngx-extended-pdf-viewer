The default is `false`.\n * @property {string} [password] - For decrypting password-protected PDFs.\n * @property {TypedArray} [initialData] - A typed array with the first portion\n *   or all of the pdf data. Used by the extension since some data is already\n *   loaded before the switch to range requests.\n * @property {number} [length] - The PDF file length. It's used for progress\n *   reports and range requests operations.\n * @property {PDFDataRangeTransport} [range] - Allows for using a custom range\n *   transport implementation.\n * @property {number} [rangeChunkSize] - Specify maximum number of bytes fetched\n *   per range request. The default value is {@link DEFAULT_RANGE_CHUNK_SIZE}.\n * @property {PDFWorker} [worker] - The worker that will be used for loading and\n *   parsing the PDF data.\n * @property {number} [verbosity] - Controls the logging level; the constants\n *   from {@link VerbosityLevel} should be used.\n * @property {string} [docBaseUrl] - The base URL of the document, used when\n *   attempting to recover valid absolute URLs for annotations, and outline\n *   items, that (incorrectly) only specify relative URLs.\n * @property {string} [cMapUrl] - The URL where the predefined Adobe CMaps are\n *   located. Include the trailing slash.\n * @property {boolean} [cMapPacked] - Specifies if the Adobe CMaps are binary\n *   packed or not.\n * @property {Object} [CMapReaderFactory] - The factory that will be used when\n *   reading built-in CMap files. Providing a custom factory is useful for\n *   environments without Fetch API or `XMLHttpRequest` support, such as\n *   Node.js. The default value is {DOMCMapReaderFactory}.\n * @property {boolean} [stopAtErrors] - Reject certain promises, e.g.\n *   `getOperatorList`, `getTextContent`, and `RenderTask`, when the associated\n *   PDF data cannot be successfully parsed, instead of attempting to recover\n *   whatever possible of the data. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {number} [maxImageSize] - The maximum allowed image size in total\n *   pixels, i.e. width * height. Images above this value will not be rendered.\n *   Use -1 for no limit, which is also the default value.\n * @property {boolean} [isEvalSupported] - Determines if we can evaluate strings\n *   as JavaScript. Primarily used to improve performance of font rendering, and\n *   when parsing PDF functions. The default value is `true`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableFontFace] - By default fonts are converted to\n *   OpenType fonts and loaded via `@font-face` rules. If disabled, fonts will\n *   be rendered using a built-in font renderer that constructs the glyphs with\n *   primitive path commands. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [fontExtraProperties] - Include additional properties,\n *   which are unused during rendering of PDF documents, when exporting the\n *   parsed font data from the worker-thread. This may be useful for debugging\n *   purposes (and backwards compatibility), but note that it will lead to\n *   increased memory usage. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [enableXfa] - Render Xfa forms if any.\n *   The default value is `false`.\n * @property {HTMLDocument} [ownerDocument] - Specify an explicit document\n *   context to create elements with and to load resources, such as fonts,\n *   into. Defaults to the current document.\n * @property {boolean} [disableRange] - Disable range request loading of PDF\n *   files. When enabled, and if the server supports partial content requests,\n *   then the PDF will be fetched in chunks. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableStream] - Disable streaming of PDF file data.\n *   By default PDF.js attempts to load PDF files in chunks. The default value\n *   is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableAutoFetch] - Disable pre-fetching of PDF file\n *   data. When range requests are enabled PDF.js will automatically keep\n *   fetching more data even if it isn't needed to display the current page.\n *   The default value is `false`.\n *\n *   NOTE: It is also necessary to disable streaming, see above, in order for\n *   disabling of pre-fetching to work correctly.\n * @property {boolean} [pdfBug] - Enables special hooks for debugging PDF.js\n *   (see `web/debugger.js`). The default value is `false`.\n */\n\n/**\n * This is the main entry point for loading a PDF and interacting with it.\n *\n * NOTE: If a URL is used to fetch the PDF data a standard Fetch API call (or\n * XHR as fallback) is used, which means it must follow same origin rules,\n * e.g. no cross-domain requests without CORS.\n *\n * @param {string|URL|TypedArray|PDFDataRangeTransport|DocumentInitParameters}\n *   src - Can be a URL where a PDF file is located, a typed array (Uint8Array)\n *         already populated with data, or a parameter object.\n * @returns {PDFDocumentLoadingTask}\n */\nfunction getDocument(src) {\n  const task = new PDFDocumentLoadingTask();\n\n  let source;\n  if (typeof src === \"string\" || src instanceof URL) {\n    source = { url: src };\n  } else if (isArrayBuffer(src)) {\n    source = { data: src };\n  } else if (src instanceof PDFDataRangeTransport) {\n    source = { range: src };\n  } else {\n    if (typeof src !== \"object\") {\n      throw new Error(\n        \"Invalid parameter in getDocument, \" +\n          \"need either string, URL, Uint8Array, or parameter object.\"\n      );\n    }\n    if (!src.url && !src.data && !src.range) {\n      throw new Error(\n        \"Invalid parameter object: need either .data, .range or .url\"\n      );\n    }\n    source = src;\n  }\n  const params = Object.create(null);\n  let rangeTransport = null,\n    worker = null;\n\n  for (const key in source) {\n    const value = source[key];\n\n    switch (key) {\n      case \"url\":\n        if (typeof window !== \"undefined\") {\n          try {\n            // The full path is required in the 'url' field.\n            params[key] = new URL(value, window.location).href;\n            continue;\n          } catch (ex) {\n            warn(`Cannot create valid URL: \"${ex}\".`);\n          }\n        } else if (typeof value === \"string\" || value instanceof URL) {\n          params[key] = value.toString(); // Support Node.js environments.\n          continue;\n        }\n        throw new Error(\n          \"Invalid PDF url data: \" +\n            \"either string or URL-object is expected in the url property.\"\n        );\n      case \"range\":\n        rangeTransport = value;\n        continue;\n      case \"worker\":\n        worker = value;\n        continue;\n      case \"data\":\n        // Converting string or array-like data to Uint8Array.\n        if (\n          typeof PDFJSDev !== \"undefined\" &&\n          PDFJSDev.test(\"GENERIC\") &&\n          isNodeJS &&\n          typeof Buffer !== \"undefined\" && // eslint-disable-line no-undef\n          value instanceof Buffer // eslint-disable-line no-undef\n        ) {\n          params[key] = new Uint8Array(value);\n        } else if (value instanceof Uint8Array) {\n          break; // Use the data as-is when it's already a Uint8Array.\n        } else if (typeof value === \"string\") {\n          params[key] = stringToBytes(value);\n        } else if (\n          typeof value === \"object\" &&\n          value !== null &&\n          !isNaN(value.length)\n        ) {\n          params[key] = new Uint8Array(value);\n        } else if (isArrayBuffer(value)) {\n          params[key] = new Uint8Array(value);\n        } else {\n          throw new Error(\n            \"Invalid PDF binary data: either typed array, \" +\n              \"string, or array-like object is expected in the data property.\"\n          );\n        }\n        continue;\n    }\n    params[key] = value;\n  }\n\n  params.rangeChunkSize = params.rangeChunkSize || DEFAULT_RANGE_CHUNK_SIZE;\n  params.CMapReaderFactory =\n    params.CMapReaderFactory || DefaultCMapReaderFactory;\n  params.ignoreErrors = params.stopAtErrors !== true;\n  params.fontExtraProperties = params.fontExtraProperties === true;\n  params.pdfBug = params.pdfBug === true;\n  params.enableXfa = params.enableXfa === true;\n\n  if (\n    typeof params.docBaseUrl !== \"string\" ||\n    isDataScheme(params.docBaseUrl)\n  ) {\n    // Ignore \"data:\"-URLs, since they can't be used to recover valid absolute\n    // URLs anyway.
