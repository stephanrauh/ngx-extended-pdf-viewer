The default value is 2^16 = 65536.\n * @property {PDFWorker}  [worker] - The worker that will be used for\n *   the loading and parsing of the PDF data.\n * @property {number} [verbosity] - Controls the logging level; the\n *   constants from {VerbosityLevel} should be used.\n * @property {string} [docBaseUrl] - The base URL of the document,\n *   used when attempting to recover valid absolute URLs for annotations, and\n *   outline items, that (incorrectly) only specify relative URLs.\n * @property {string} [cMapUrl] - The URL where the predefined\n *   Adobe CMaps are located. Include trailing slash.\n * @property {boolean} [cMapPacked] - Specifies if the Adobe CMaps are\n *   binary packed.\n * @property {Object} [CMapReaderFactory] - The factory that will be\n *   used when reading built-in CMap files. Providing a custom factory is useful\n *   for environments without `XMLHttpRequest` support, such as e.g. Node.js.\n *   The default value is {DOMCMapReaderFactory}.\n * @property {boolean} [stopAtErrors] - Reject certain promises, e.g.\n *   `getOperatorList`, `getTextContent`, and `RenderTask`, when the associated\n *   PDF data cannot be successfully parsed, instead of attempting to recover\n *   whatever possible of the data. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {number} [maxImageSize] - The maximum allowed image size\n *   in total pixels, i.e. width * height. Images above this value will not be\n *   rendered.

Primarily used to improve performance of font rendering,\n *   and when parsing PDF functions. The default value is `true`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableFontFace] - By default fonts are\n *   converted to OpenType fonts and loaded via font face rules. If disabled,\n *   fonts will be rendered using a built-in font renderer that constructs the\n *   glyphs with primitive path commands. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [fontExtraProperties] - Include additional properties,\n *   which are unused during rendering of PDF documents, when exporting the\n *   parsed font data from the worker-thread. This may be useful for debugging\n *   purposes (and backwards compatibility), but note that it will lead to\n *   increased memory usage. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableRange] - Disable range request loading\n *   of PDF files. When enabled, and if the server supports partial content\n *   requests, then the PDF will be fetched in chunks.\n *   The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableStream] - Disable streaming of PDF file\n *   data. By default PDF.js attempts to load PDFs in chunks.\n *   The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableAutoFetch] - Disable pre-fetching of PDF\n *   file data. When range requests are enabled PDF.js will automatically keep\n *   fetching more data even if it isn't needed to display the current page.\n *   The default value is `false`.\n *   NOTE: It is also necessary to disable streaming, see above,\n *         in order for disabling of pre-fetching to work correctly.\n * @property {boolean} [pdfBug] - Enables special hooks for debugging\n *   PDF.js (see `web/debugger.js`). The default value is `false`.\n */\n\n/**\n * @typedef {Object} PDFDocumentStats\n * @property {Object} streamTypes - Used stream types in the document (an item\n *   is set to true if specific stream ID was used in the document).\n * @property {Object} fontTypes - Used font types in the document (an item\n *   is set to true if specific font ID was used in the document).\n */\n\n/**\n * This is the main entry point for loading a PDF and interacting with it.\n * NOTE: If a URL is used to fetch the PDF data a standard XMLHttpRequest(XHR)\n * is used, which means it must follow the same origin rules that any XHR does\n * e.g. No cross domain requests without CORS.\n *\n * @param {string|TypedArray|DocumentInitParameters|PDFDataRangeTransport} src\n * Can be a url to where a PDF is located, a typed array (Uint8Array)\n * already populated with data or parameter object.\n * @returns {PDFDocumentLoadingTask}\n */\nfunction getDocument(src) {\n  const task = new PDFDocumentLoadingTask();\n\n  let source;\n  if (typeof src === \"string\") {\n    source = { url: src };\n  } else if (isArrayBuffer(src)) {\n    source = { data: src };\n  } else if (src instanceof PDFDataRangeTransport) {\n    source = { range: src };\n  } else {\n    if (typeof src !== \"object\") {\n      throw new Error(\n        \"Invalid parameter in getDocument, \" +\n          \"need either Uint8Array, string or a parameter object\"\n      );\n    }\n    if (!src.url && !src.data && !src.range) {\n      throw new Error(\n        \"Invalid parameter object: need either .data, .range or .url\"\n      );\n    }\n    source = src;\n  }\n  const params = Object.create(null);\n  let rangeTransport = null,\n    worker = null;\n\n  for (const key in source) {\n    if (key === \"url\" && typeof window !== \"undefined\") {\n      // The full path is required in the 'url' field.\n      params[key] = new URL(source[key], window.location).href;\n      continue;\n    } else if (key === \"range\") {\n      rangeTransport = source[key];\n      continue;\n    } else if (key === \"worker\") {\n      worker = source[key];\n      continue;\n    } else if (key === \"data\" && !(source[key] instanceof Uint8Array)) {\n      // Converting string or array-like data to Uint8Array.\n      const pdfBytes = source[key];\n      if (typeof pdfBytes === \"string\") {\n        params[key] = stringToBytes(pdfBytes);\n      } else if (\n        typeof pdfBytes === \"object\" &&\n        pdfBytes !== null &&\n        !isNaN(pdfBytes.length)\n      ) {\n        params[key] = new Uint8Array(pdfBytes);\n      } else if (isArrayBuffer(pdfBytes)) {\n        params[key] = new Uint8Array(pdfBytes);\n      } else {\n        throw new Error(\n          \"Invalid PDF binary data: either typed array, \" +\n            \"string or array-like object is expected in the \" +\n            \"data property.\"\n        );\n      }\n      continue;\n    }\n    params[key] = source[key];\n  }\n\n  params.rangeChunkSize = params.rangeChunkSize || DEFAULT_RANGE_CHUNK_SIZE;\n  params.CMapReaderFactory = params.CMapReaderFactory || DOMCMapReaderFactory;\n  params.ignoreErrors = params.stopAtErrors !== true;\n  params.fontExtraProperties = params.fontExtraProperties === true;\n  params.pdfBug = params.pdfBug === true;\n\n  if (!Number.isInteger(params.maxImageSize)) {\n    params.maxImageSize = -1;\n  }\n  if (typeof params.isEvalSupported !== \"boolean\") {\n    params.isEvalSupported = true;\n  }\n  if (typeof params.disableFontFace !== \"boolean\") {\n    // modified by ngx-extended-pdf-viewer - we don't need the api compatibility\n    params.disableFontFace = false;\n    // end of modification\n  }\n\n  if (typeof params.disableRange !== \"boolean\") {\n    params.disableRange = false;\n  }\n  if (typeof params.disableStream !== \"boolean\") {\n    params.disableStream = false;\n  }\n  if (typeof params.disableAutoFetch !== \"boolean\") {\n    params.disableAutoFetch = false;\n  }\n\n  // Set the main-thread verbosity level.\n  setVerbosityLevel(params.verbosity);\n\n  if (!worker) {\n    const workerParams = {\n      verbosity: params.verbosity,\n      port: GlobalWorkerOptions.workerPort,\n    };\n    // Worker was not provided -- creating and owning our own.
