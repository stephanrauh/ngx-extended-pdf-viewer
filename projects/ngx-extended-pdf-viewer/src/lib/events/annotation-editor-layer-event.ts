/**
 * Payload of the `annotationEditorEvent` output. It is emitted whenever the user
 * adds, edits, moves, resizes or removes an annotation with one of the built-in
 * editors (highlight, ink/draw, free text, image stamp, signature).
 *
 * ## Coordinates are normalized (0..1)
 *
 * For the position/size related events (`added`, `moved`, `sizeChanged`) the
 * `value` carries an `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`. These are **not** pixels and
 * **not** PDF points — they are fractions between 0 and 1, relative to the page
 * and measured from the **top-left** corner (x grows right, y grows down). That
 * is why you see "strange numbers less than one".
 *
 * - `moved` → `value: { x, y }` (interactive drag) or `value: { x, y, page }`
 *   plus `previousValue: { x, y, page }` (keyboard nudge / multi-select move).
 * - `sizeChanged` → `value: { x, y, width, height }` holding the dimensions
 *   *before* the resize. For the current rectangle read it from the live editor:
 *   `event.source.x / .y / .width / .height`.
 *
 * These raw `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` are stored in whatever rotation the page had
 * when the annotation was added (for 90°/270° the axes are swapped and `y` is the
 * bottom edge). For a rotation-independent rectangle in the page's un-rotated
 * frame — e.g. to take a screenshot — read `event.source.normalizedPageRect`
 * instead, and hand it straight to
 * `NgxExtendedPdfViewerService.getPageAsCanvas(page, scale, ..., cropBox)`.
 *
 * To convert these fractions:
 * - **to canvas pixels** (e.g. for a screenshot): multiply by the canvas width/height (no flip needed,
 *   both use a top-left origin). Prefer `event.source.normalizedPageRect` as the
 *   `cropBox` so rotated pages work too.
 * - **to PDF user-space points** (bottom-left origin): use
 *   `pdfPage.getViewport({ scale }).convertToViewportRectangle(...)` or call
 *   `event.source.getRect(0, 0)`.
 *
 * See the "Coordinate systems" page of the showcase for a worked example.
