This may be useful for debugging\n *   purposes (and backwards compatibility), but note that it will lead to\n *   increased memory usage. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [enableXfa] - Render Xfa forms if any.\n *   The default value is `false`.\n * @property {HTMLDocument} [ownerDocument] - Specify an explicit document\n *   context to create elements with and to load resources, such as fonts,\n *   into. Defaults to the current document.\n * @property {boolean} [disableRange] - Disable range request loading of PDF\n *   files.
