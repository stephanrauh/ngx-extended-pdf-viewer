The default value is `false`.\n * @property {number} [maxImageSize] - The maximum allowed image size in total\n *   pixels, i.e. width * height. Images above this value will not be rendered.\n *   Use -1 for no limit, which is also the default value.\n * @property {boolean} [isEvalSupported] - Determines if we can evaluate strings\n *   as JavaScript. Primarily used to improve performance of font rendering, and\n *   when parsing PDF functions. The default value is `true`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableFontFace] - By default fonts are converted to\n *   OpenType fonts and loaded via the Font Loading API or `@font-face` rules.\n *   If disabled, fonts will be rendered using a built-in font renderer that\n *   constructs the glyphs with primitive path commands.\n *   The default value is `false` in web environments and `true` in Node.js.\n * @property {boolean} [fontExtraProperties] - Include additional properties,\n *   which are unused during rendering of PDF documents, when exporting the\n *   parsed font data from the worker-thread. This may be useful for debugging\n *   purposes (and backwards compatibility), but note that it will lead to\n *   increased memory usage. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [enableXfa] - Render Xfa forms if any.\n *   The default value is `false`.\n * @property {HTMLDocument} [ownerDocument] - Specify an explicit document\n *   context to create elements with and to load resources, such as fonts,\n *   into.
