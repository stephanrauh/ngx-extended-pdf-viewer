This may be useful for debugging\n *   purposes (and backwards compatibility), but note that it will lead to\n *   increased memory usage. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [enableXfa] - Render Xfa forms if any.\n *   The default value is `false`.\n * @property {HTMLDocument} [ownerDocument] - Specify an explicit document\n *   context to create elements with and to load resources, such as fonts,\n *   into. Defaults to the current document.\n * @property {boolean} [disableRange] - Disable range request loading of PDF\n *   files.

Notes from Rik on implementing:\n    // - When you encounter an transparency group, create a new canvas with\n    // the dimensions of the bbox\n    // - copy the content from the previous canvas to the new canvas\n    // - draw as usual\n    // - remove the backdrop alpha:\n    // alphaNew = 1 - (1 - alpha)/(1 - alphaBackdrop) with 'alpha' the alpha\n    // value of your transparency group and 'alphaBackdrop' the alpha of the\n    // backdrop\n    // - remove background color:\n    // colorNew = color - alphaNew *colorBackdrop /(1 - alphaNew)\n    if (!group.isolated) {\n      info(\"TODO: Support non-isolated groups.\");\n    }\n\n    // TODO knockout -
