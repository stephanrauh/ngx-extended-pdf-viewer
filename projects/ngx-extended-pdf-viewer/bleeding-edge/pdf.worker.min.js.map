width/height must be lower than the given ones in\n * the initial space.\n * So if the container has known dimensions and these ones are ok with the\n * space then continue else we return HTMLResult.FAILURE: it's up to the\n * parent to deal with this failure (e.g. if parent layout is lr-tb and\n * we fail to add a child at end of line (lr) then we try to add it on the\n * next line).\n * And then we run through the children, each child gets its initial space\n * in calling its parent $getAvailableSpace method\n * (see _filteredChildrenGenerator and $childrenToHTML in xfa_object.js)\n * then we try to layout child in its space. If everything is ok then we add\n * the result to its parent through $addHTML which will recompute the available\n * space in parent according to its layout property else we return\n * HTMLResult.Failure.\n * Before a failure some children may have been layed out: they've been saved in\n * [$extra].children and [$extra] has properties generator and failingNode\n * in order to save the state where we were before a failure.\n * This [$extra].children property is useful when a container has to be splited.\n * So if a container is unbreakable, we must delete its [$extra] property before\n * returning.\n */\n\nfunction createLine(node, children) {\n  return {\n    name: \"div\",\n    attributes: {\n      class: [node.layout === \"lr-tb\" ? \"xfaLr\" : \"xfaRl\"],\n    },\n    children,\n  };\n}\n\nfunction flushHTML(node) {\n  if (!node[$extra]) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const attributes = node[$extra].attributes;\n  const html = {\n    name: \"div\",\n    attributes,\n    children: node[$extra].children,\n  };\n\n  if (node[$extra].failingNode) {\n    const htmlFromFailing = node[$extra].failingNode[$flushHTML]();\n    if (htmlFromFailing) {\n      if (node.layout.endsWith(\"-tb\")) {\n        html.children.push(createLine(node, [htmlFromFailing]));\n      } else {\n        html.children.push(htmlFromFailing);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (html.children.length === 0) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return html;\n}\n\nfunction addHTML(node, html, bbox) {\n  const extra = node[$extra];\n  const availableSpace = extra.availableSpace;\n\n  const [x, y, w, h] = bbox;\n  switch (node.layout) {\n    case \"position\": {\n      extra.width = Math.max(extra.width, x + w);\n      extra.height = Math.max(extra.height, y + h);\n      extra.children.push(html);\n      break;\n    }\n    case \"lr-tb\":\n    case \"rl-tb\":\n      if (!extra.line || extra.attempt === 1) {\n        extra.line = createLine(node, []);\n        extra.children.push(extra.line);\n        extra.numberInLine = 0;\n      }\n\n      extra.numberInLine += 1;\n      extra.line.children.push(html);\n\n      if (extra.attempt === 0) {\n        // Add the element on the line\n        extra.currentWidth += w;\n        extra.height = Math.max(extra.height, extra.prevHeight + h);\n      } else {\n        extra.currentWidth = w;\n        extra.prevHeight = extra.height;\n        extra.height += h;\n\n        // The element has been added on a new line so switch to line mode now.\n        extra.attempt = 0;\n      }\n      extra.width = Math.max(extra.width, extra.currentWidth);\n      break;\n    case \"rl-row\":\n    case \"row\": {\n      extra.children.push(html);\n      extra.width += w;\n      extra.height = Math.max(extra.height, h);\n      const height = measureToString(extra.height);\n      for (const child of extra.children) {\n        child.attributes.style.height = height;\n      }\n      break;\n    }\n    case \"table\": {\n      extra.width = Math.min(availableSpace.width, Math.max(extra.width, w));\n      extra.height += h;\n      extra.children.push(html);\n      break;\n    }\n    case \"tb\": {\n      // Even if the subform can possibly take all the available width,\n      // we must compute the final width as it is in order to be able\n      // for example to center the subform within its parent.\n      extra.width = Math.min(availableSpace.width, Math.max(extra.width, w));\n      extra.height += h;\n      extra.children.push(html);\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfunction getAvailableSpace(node) {\n  const availableSpace = node[$extra].availableSpace;\n  const marginV = node.margin\n    ? node.margin.topInset + node.margin.bottomInset\n    : 0;\n  const marginH = node.margin\n    ? node.margin.leftInset + node.margin.rightInset\n    : 0;\n\n  switch (node.layout) {\n    case \"lr-tb\":\n    case \"rl-tb\":\n      if (node[$extra].attempt === 0) {\n        return {\n          width: availableSpace.width - marginH - node[$extra].currentWidth,\n          height: availableSpace.height - marginV - node[$extra].prevHeight,\n        };\n      }\n      return {\n        width: availableSpace.width - marginH,\n        height: availableSpace.height - marginV - node[$extra].height,\n      };\n    case \"rl-row\":\n    case \"row\":\n      const width = node[$extra].columnWidths\n        .slice(node[$extra].currentColumn)\n        .reduce((a, x) => a + x);\n      return { width, height: availableSpace.height - marginH };\n    case \"table\":\n    case \"tb\":\n      return {\n        width: availableSpace.width - marginH,\n        height: availableSpace.height - marginV - node[$extra].height,\n      };\n    case \"position\":\n    default:\n      return availableSpace;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction getTransformedBBox(node) {\n  // Take into account rotation and anchor to get the real bounding box.\n  let w = node.w === \"\" ?
